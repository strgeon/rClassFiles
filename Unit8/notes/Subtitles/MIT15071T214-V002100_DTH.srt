1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,800
Radiation therapy is one of the most well used applications

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,490
of optimization in health care.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,130
In practice, radiation machines are

4
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:13,090
connected to treatment planning software that

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,320
implements and solves optimization

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,810
models, both linear optimization models, like we saw here,

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,080
and other types of optimization models.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,360
Some examples of radiation machines

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,720
that use optimization software are Pinnacle by Philips,

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,560
RayStation by RaySearch Labs, and Eclipse by Varian.

11
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,400


12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,230
There are many extensions to the optimization model

13
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,990
we described here.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,660
One is the selection of beam angles.

15
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,970
The beam angles can be selected jointly with the intensity

16
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:52,970
profiles by using integer optimization.

17
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,960
This allows the treatment to be further personalized

18
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,040
to the specific tumor and person receiving the radiation.

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,650
Integer optimization is another type of optimization model

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,020
and will be the topic of next week.

21
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,900
Another extension is accounting for uncertainty.

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,560
Often, the quality of IMRT treatments

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,420
is degraded due to uncertain organ motion.

24
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,880
For example, in lung cancer the target area

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,800
is around the lungs.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,380
But since the patient is breathing

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,390
throughout the treatment, the target area is moving

28
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,800
and the location is slightly uncertain.

29
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,100
We can manage this uncertainty using

30
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,770
a method known as robust optimization.

31
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,770
There is a significant amount of literature on this method

32
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,945
and its application to radiation therapy.

33
00:01:42,945 --> 00:01:45,590


34
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,940
Linear optimization significantly

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,580
improves the efficiency of radiation therapy.

36
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,520
Manually designing an IMRT treatment

37
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,450
would be inefficient and impractical.

38
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,610
By using linear optimization, IMRT

39
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,780
can be designed in an efficient and systematic way.

40
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,650
As we saw in this lecture, clinical criteria

41
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,289
can be modeled using constraints,

42
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,780
and the treatment planner can explore trade-offs

43
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,650
by changing the model.

44
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,330
But ultimately, IMRT and the use of optimization

45
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,280
benefits the patient.

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,280
In head and neck cancers, saliva glands

47
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,450
were rarely spared prior to IMRT.

48
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,780
But by using optimized IMRT treatments,

49
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,040
saliva glands can now be spared.

50
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,130
In prostate cancer, IMRT treatments

51
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,710
reduce toxicities and allow for higher tumor doses

52
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,110
to be delivered safely.

53
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,540
And in lung cancer, optimized IMRT

54
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,000
reduced the risk of radiation induced pneumonitis.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,570
These are just three examples of the benefits of IMRT.

56
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,330
Overall, optimized IMRT allows clinicians

57
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,930
to deliver treatment that was previously impossible

58
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,815
and to improve the quality of life for patients.

59
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:07,314
