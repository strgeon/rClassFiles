00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,580
So far, we've only considered optimizing the fares

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,610
for a single route.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:09,200
In this video, we'll change our optimization formulation

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,780
to include connecting flights.

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,059
Now, instead of just being able to go from JFK in New York

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,280
to LAX in Los Angeles, let's suppose that the plane stops

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,150
in Dallas at the Dallas Fort Worth airport.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,700
We still are just using one plane,

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,460
but the passengers can now fly from New York

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,080
to Dallas, Dallas to Los Angeles,

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,910
or from New York to Los Angeles by just

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,490
staying on the plane in Dallas.

13
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,560
So how does our optimization problem change?

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,200
We now have six types of seats that we can offer:

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,380
the original two types, regular and discount

16
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,310
from New York to LA, and four new types.

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,630
We can sell both regular and discount seats

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:00,190
from New York to Dallas, and regular and discount

19
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,100
seats from Dallas to Los Angeles.

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,330
We know the price of each type of ticket

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,450
as well as the forecasted demand for each type of ticket.

22
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,730
We also know that we have a capacity

23
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,290
of 166 seats on our plane for each leg of the trip.

24
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,540
There's room for 166 passengers on the plane from New

25
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,960
York to Dallas, or the first leg of the trip.

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,250
Then the passengers with a final destination of Dallas

27
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,270
will get off the plane and the passengers flying from Dallas

28
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,140
to LA will get on the plane.

29
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,410
On the second leg of the trip, flying from Dallas to LA,

30
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,380
we also have a capacity of 166 seats.

31
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,610
So we need to remember that the passengers flying

32
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,230
from New York to LA will take up capacity

33
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:56,750
on both legs of the trip, while the other types of passengers

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,120
will only take up capacity on one leg of the trip.

35
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,580
So what are our decisions now?

36
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,830
They're the number of regular tickets to sell for each type,

37
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,690
and the number of discount tickets to sell for each type.

38
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,090
So in total, we have six decisions to make.

39
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,790
Now, let's define our objective.

40
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,910
Like before, it's to maximize the total revenue.

41
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,810
This is the sum of the price of the ticket times the number

42
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,480
of seats of that type we sell, for each type of ticket.

43
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,860
And like before, we have two types of constraints-- capacity

44
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,780
constraints and demand constraints.

45
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,490
For the capacity constraints, the airline

46
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,870
shouldn't sell more seats than the capacity of the plane,

47
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,050
for each leg of the trip.

48
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,970
So we need two capacity constraints here:

49
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,410
one for the New York to Dallas leg and one for the Dallas

50
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,150
to LA leg.

51
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,150
Note that the New York to LA passengers

52
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,420
have to be counted on both legs of the trip.

53
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,620
So the first constraint accounts for all passengers that

54
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,960
need to be on the plane when it flies from New York to Dallas,

55
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,350
and the second constraint accounts for all passengers

56
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,870
that need to be on the plane when

57
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,880
it flies from Dallas to LA.

58
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,840
We also need six demand constraints,

59
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,200
one for each type of ticket.

60
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,140
The number of seats sold should not

61
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,400
exceed the forecasted demand for each type.

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,020
And lastly, we can't sell a negative number of seats,

63
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,770
so we have our non-negativity constraints

64
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,300
to prevent the variables from being negative.

65
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,240
Let's now go to LibreOffice and adjust our formulation

66
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,350
to solve this bigger problem.

67
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,529
In LibreOffice, go ahead and open the file

68
00:03:50,529 --> 00:03:51,820
Week9_AirlineRM_Connecting.ods.

69
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,650


70
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,160
In this file, I've set up our data, our decisions,

71
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,080
our objective, and our constraints.

72
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,040
Our decisions, again, are highlighted in yellow.

73
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,170
We have a decision for each type of seat on each flight.

74
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,890
Our objective here is the spot in blue.

75
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,519
To build our objective, we'll use the sumproduct function.

76
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,840
So type = and then sumproduct, and in parentheses,

77
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,900
select all six prices, type a semicolon,

78
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,740
and then select all six decisions.

79
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,680
Close the parentheses and hit Enter.

80
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,910
We see here, like we did before, that we

81
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,960
have 0 in our objective, because right now, we're

82
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,740
not selling any seats.

83
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,370
Now let's create our constraints.

84
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,810
The first constraints are capacity constraints.

85
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,290
The first is the capacity on the leg from New York to Dallas.

86
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,430
The left-hand side should be equal to the seats from New

87
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:04,500
York to LA plus the seats from New York to Dallas.

88
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,810
The sign is less than or equals and the right-hand side

89
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,330
is 166, the capacity of our aircraft.

90
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,360
Now we need to build the capacity constraint from Dallas

91
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,580
to LA.

92
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,570
The left-hand side is equal to the seats from New York

93
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,870
to LA plus the seats from Dallas to LA.

94
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,540


95
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,930
Our sign is, again, less than or equals

96
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,470
and our right-hand side is 166.

97
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,290
For the demand constraints and the non-negativity constraints,

98
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,580
because we have six of each this time,

99
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,120
we'll actually make them in a more efficient way than before.

100
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,700
So we just have a note down there

101
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,980
that we need to remember to add these constraints.

102
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,500
So now go ahead and in the Tools menu, select Solver.

103
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,980
We need to first fill in the target cell, which

104
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,220
should be the objective.

105
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,420
Make sure that Maximum is selected.

106
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:05,650
Then, in the Changing Cells box, select all six decisions.

107
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,680
Down in the Limiting Conditions, let's now

108
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,440
build our constraints.

109
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,790
For the Cell Reference column, let's start

110
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,760
by selecting the left-hand side of the two capacity

111
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,200
constraints.

112
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,100
The Operator should be less than or equals

113
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,800
and the Value should be the right-hand side of these two

114
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,480
capacity constraints.

115
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,190
Now let's make the demand constraints.

116
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,210
In Cell Reference, just directly select the six decision

117
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,680
variables, make sure the Operator's less than or equals,

118
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,810
and for the Value, select the six demand constraints.

119
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,630
This is a bit easier than what we did before because we didn't

120
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,760
have to type them all out in our spreadsheet.

121
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,460
Now let's do a similar thing for the non-negativity constraints,

122
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,020
where in Cell Reference, we select the six decisions.

123
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,590
The Operator this time should be greater than or equals,

124
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,710
and for the Value, just type 0.

125
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,940
Make sure in Options that the Linear Solver is selected,

126
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,130
and go ahead and hit Solve.

127
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,200
The solving result should say: "Solving successfully finished.

128
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,880
Result: 120,514."

129
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,730
This is our total revenue.

130
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,420
Go ahead and click Keep Result, and let's

131
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,540
take a look at our solution.

132
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,060
So we see here that the optimal solution

133
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,570
is to sell 80 tickets for the regular price from New

134
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,590
York to LA, 0 of the discount price from New York to LA,

135
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,800
75 of the regular price from New York to Dallas,

136
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,690
11 of the discount price from New York to Dallas,

137
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,910
60 of the regular price from Dallas to LA,

138
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,680
and lastly, 26 of the discount price from Dallas to LA.

139
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,880
We saw here that we could pretty easily

140
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,510
solve a more complicated problem in LibreOffice

141
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,290
that we probably couldn't have solved as easily by inspection.
