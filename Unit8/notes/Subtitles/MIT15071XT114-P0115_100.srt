Hello.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,170
This week we'll discuss a new area

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,660
of analytics, optimization.

4
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,230
In the first lecture, we'll see how American Airlines used

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,240
revenue management to offer discounted fares

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,440
and beat the competition.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,730
Through this example, we teach you

8
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,150
how to solve optimization problems with a spreadsheet

9
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,630
software.

10
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,680
In the second lecture, we'll discuss

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,050
how optimization is used to design radiation therapy

12
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,310
treatments.

13
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,350
Let's get started.

14
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,187
