00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440


1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,840
So, we saw in the previous video that the house prices

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,510
were distributed over the area in an interesting way,

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,400
certainly not the kind of linear way.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,580
And we wouldn't necessarily expect linear regression

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,030
to do very well at predicting house price,

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,410
just given latitude and longitude.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,610
We can kind of develop that intuition more

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:28,030
by plotting the relationship between latitude and house

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:34,950
prices-- which doesn't look very linear-- or the longitude

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,310
and the house prices, which also looks pretty nonlinear.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,290
So, we'll try fitting a linear regression anyway.

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,550
So, let's call it latlonlm.

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,210
And we'll use the lm command, linear model,

14
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:58,010
to predict house prices based on latitude and longitude using

15
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,320
the boston data set.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,250
If we take a look at our linear regression,

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,430
we see the R-squared is around 0.1, which is not great.

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,450
The latitude is not significant, which

19
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,510
means the north-south differences aren't

20
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,250
going to be really used at all.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,990
Longitude is significant, and it's negative.

22
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,940
Which we can interpret as, as we go towards the ocean--

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,690
as we go towards the east-- house prices decrease linearly.

24
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,330
So this all seems kind of unlikely,

25
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,450
but let's work with it.

26
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,380
So let's see how this linear regression

27
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,290
model looks on a plot.

28
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,260
So let's plot the census tracts again.

29
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,120
OK.

30
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,620
Now, remember before, we had-- from the previous video--

31
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,420
we plotted the above-median house prices.

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,350
So we're going to do that one more time.

33
00:01:54,350 --> 00:02:10,130
The median was 21.2.

34
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,390
We had-- the color was red.

35
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,240
And we used solid dots.

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,830


37
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,330
Ha.

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:20,890
Oops.

39
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,020
See what I did there?

40
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,390
I used the plot command, instead of the points command,

41
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,390
and it plotted just the new points.

42
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,820
I meant to plot the original points

43
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,750
and use the points command to plot it

44
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,091
on top of the existing plot.

45
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:38,590
OK.

46
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,700
So that's more like it.

47
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,860
So now we have the median values with the above median value

48
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,760
census tracts.

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,700
So, OK, we want to see, now, the question

50
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,310
we're going to ask, and then plot,

51
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,510
is what does the linear regression model think is above median.

52
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,170
So we could just do this pretty easily.

53
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:09,660
We have latlonlm$fitted.values and this is what the linear

54
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,760
regression model predicts for each of the 506 census tracts.

55
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,970
So we'll plot these on top.

56
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,260
boston$LON-- take all the census tracts,

57
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:30,380
such that the latlonlm's fitted values are above the median.

58
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,630
Take the latitudes, too.

59
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:39,490


60
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,271
And I'm going to make them blue, but let's pause for a moment

61
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:44,770
and think.

62
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,910
If we use the dots again, we'll cover up the red dots

63
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,810
and cover up some of the black dots.

64
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,060
What we won't be able to see is where

65
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,220
the red dots and the blue dots match up.

66
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,720
You know, we're interested in seeing

67
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,370
how the linear regression matches up with the truth.

68
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,040
So it'd be ideal if we could plot

69
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,840
the linear regression blue dots on top of the red dots,

70
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,470
in some way that we can still see the red dots.

71
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,300
It turns out that you can actually

72
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,980
pass in characters to this PCH option.

73
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,990
So since we're talking about money,

74
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,620
let's plot dollar signs instead of points.

75
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,970
And there you have it.

76
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,272
So, the linear regression model has plotted a dollar sign

77
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:31,730
for every time it thinks the census

78
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,520
tract is above median value.

79
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,990
And you can see that, indeed, it's

80
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,395
almost as-- you can see the sharp line

81
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:40,240
that the linear regression defines.

82
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,270
And how it's pretty much vertical,

83
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,530
because remember before, the latitude variable

84
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,510
was not very significant in the regression.

85
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:53,802
So that's interesting and pretty wrong.

86
00:04:53,802 --> 00:04:55,260
One thing that really stands out is

87
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:00,242
how it says Boston is mostly above median.

88
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:02,200
Even knowing-- we saw it right from the start--

89
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,190
there's a big non-red spot, right

90
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,542
in the middle of Boston, where the house

91
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,750
prices were below the median.

92
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,157
So the linear regression model isn't really doing a good job.

93
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:14,740
And it's completely ignored everything

94
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,600
to the right side of the picture.
