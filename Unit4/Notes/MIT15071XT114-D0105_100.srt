00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710


1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,880
Let us introduce the method we use

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,080
for predicting the bucket number.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,500
It is called-- it is a method called classification

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,530
and regression trees.

5
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,090
In this case, we use multi-class classification.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,120
There are five classes, buckets one to five.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,320
To give you an example, let us consider

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,490
patients that have two types of diagnosis:

9
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:27,280
coronary artery disease and diabetes.

10
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,180
So if a patient does not have a coronary artery disease,

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,200
we'd classify the patient as bucket one.

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,480
If it has coronary artery disease,

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,350
then we check whether the person has diabetes or doesn't

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,470
have diabetes.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:49,400
If it has diabetes, then it's bucket five, very high risk.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,160
And if it doesn't have diabetes, but given

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,380
it has coronary artery disease, it

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,250
is classified as bucket three.

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:02,860
So this is an example in which we only have two diagnoses

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,970
and we will state how the method works.

21
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:12,880
In the application of Hawkeye, the most important factors

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,090
were related to cost in the beginning.

23
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,970
So in the beginning, the classification tree

24
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,680
involved divisions based on cost.

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,990
For example, if the patient had paid less than $4,000--

26
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,560
so this is bucket one classification-- if it paid

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,320
more than $4,000, then we further

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,250
investigate whether the patient pays less than $40,000

29
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,940
or more than $40,000 and so forth.

30
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,825
As the tree grows, then the secondary factor

31
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:47,570
is utilized later in the classification tree

32
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,720
involve various chronic illnesses

33
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,230
and some of the medical rules we discussed earlier.

34
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,700
For example, whether or not the patient

35
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,040
has asthma and depression or not.

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,500
If it has asthma and depression, then it's bucket five.

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,740
If it doesn't, then we consider a particular indicator

38
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,440
indicating hylan injection, which

39
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,990
is an indication of a possible knee

40
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,770
replacement or arthroscopy.

41
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,850
So if this indicator is equal to 1, then it's bucket three.

42
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,000
If it's indicator is equal to 0, it's not present,

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,660
then it's bucket one.

44
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,320
So let us give some examples of bucket five.

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,630


46
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:40,270
So an example is as follows.

47
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,680
The patient is under 35 years old,

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,540
he has between 3,300 and 3,900 in claims, coronary artery

49
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,410
disease as a diagnosis, but no office visits in the last year.

50
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,960
Another example of a category of a patient that

51
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,680
is classified as bucket five are claims

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,180
between $3,900 and $43,000 with at least $8,000

53
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,010
paid in the last 12 months, $4,300 in pharmacy claims,

54
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,030
and acute cost profile and cancer diagnosis.

55
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,480
And another final example is more than $58,000 in claims,

56
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,260
but at least $50,000 paid in the last 12 months,

57
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,290
but not an acute profile.

58
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,080
Classification trees have the major advantage

59
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,030
as being interpretable by the physicians who

60
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,210
observe them and judge them.

61
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,790


62
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,970
In other words, people were able to identify

63
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,250
these cases as reasonable.

64
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,590
In other words, the human intuition

65
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,990
agreed with the output of the analytics model.
