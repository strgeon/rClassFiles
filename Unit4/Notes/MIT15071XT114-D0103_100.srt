1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,510
To build an analytics model, let us discuss the variables

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,850
we used.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,280
First, we used the 13,000 diagnoses.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,580
It's for the codes for diagnosis that claims data utilize.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,970
There were also 22,000 different codes for procedures

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,910
and 45,000 codes for prescription drugs.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,380
To work with this massive amount of variables,

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,150
we aggregated the variables as follows.

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:35,500
Out of the 13,000 diagnoses, we defined 217 diagnosis groups.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,730
Out of the 20,000 procedures, we aggregated the data

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,410
to develop 213 procedure groups.

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,330
And, finally, from 45,000 prescription drugs,

13
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:50,538
we developed 189 therapeutic groups.

14
00:00:50,538 --> 00:00:54,620
To illustrate an example of how we infer further information

15
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,340
from the data, the graph here shows

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,190
on the horizontal axis, time, and on the vertical axis,

17
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,280
costs in thousands of dollars.

18
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:19,190
So patient one is a patient who, on a monthly basis,

19
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:25,290
has costs on the order of $10,000 to $15,000, a fairly

20
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,570
significant cost but fairly constant in time.

21
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,340
Patient two has also an annual cost

22
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,590
of a similar size to patient one.

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:41,620
But in all but the third month, the costs are almost $0.

24
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,250
Whereas in the third month, it cost about $70,000.

25
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,020
In fact, this is additional data we

26
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,140
defined indicating whether the patient has

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,560
a chronic or an acute condition.

28
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,360
In addition to the initial variables, the 217 procedure

29
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,150
groups, and 189 drugs, and so forth, we also

30
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,240
defined in collaboration with medical doctors,

31
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,450
269 medically-defined rules.

32
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,320
For example, the first type of rule

33
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,960
indicates the interaction between various illnesses.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,625
For example, obesity and depression.

35
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:32,460


36
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,440
Then new variables regarding interaction

37
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,110
between diagnosis and age.

38
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,950
For example, more than 65 years old and coronary

39
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,610
artery disease.

40
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,482


41
00:02:46,482 --> 00:02:47,690
Noncompliance with treatment.

42
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,930
For example, non-fulfillment of a particular drug order.

43
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,790
And, finally, illness severity.

44
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,000
For example, severe depression as

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,620
opposed to regular depression.

46
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,520


47
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,520
And the last set of variables involve demographic information

48
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,080
like gender and age.

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,300


50
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,600
An important aspect of the variables

51
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,380
are the variables related to cost.

52
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,590
So rather than using costs directly,

53
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:27,080
we bucketed costs and considered everyone in the group equally.

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,460
So we defined five buckets.

55
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,580
So the buckets were partitioned in such a way

56
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:41,576
so that 20% of all costs is in bucket five,

57
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:45,705
20% is in bucket four, and so forth.

58
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:48,520


59
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,920
So the partitions were from 0 to 3,000, from 3,000 to 8,000,

60
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,000
from 8,000 to 19,000, from 19,000 to 55,000,

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,580
and above 55,000.

62
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:09,360
The number of patients that were below 3,000

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:18,180
was-- 78% of the patients had costs below 3,000.

64
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,019
Just to remind you, we created a bucket

65
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,980
so that the total cost in each bucket was 20% of the total.

66
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,840
But the number of patients in bucket one, for example,

67
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,670
is very high (78%).

68
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,174


69
00:04:33,174 --> 00:04:37,250
Let us interpret the buckets medically.

70
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,540
So this shows the various levels of risk.

71
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,170
Bucket one consists of patients that have rather low risk.

72
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,400
Bucket two has what is called emerging risk.

73
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,460
In bucket three, moderate level of risk.

74
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,230
Bucket four, high risk.

75
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,880
And bucket five, very high risk.

76
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,930
So from a medical perspective, buckets two and three,

77
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,820
the medical and the moderate risk patients,

78
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,620
are candidates for wellness programs.

79
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,920
Whereas bucket four, the high risk patients,

80
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,740
are candidates for disease management programs.

81
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,210
And finally bucket five, the very high risk patients,

82
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,590
are candidates for case management.
