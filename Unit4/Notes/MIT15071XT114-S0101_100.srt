00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499


1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,750
In this lecture, we'll see how analytics

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,330
can be used to predict the outcomes of cases in the United

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,580
States Supreme Court.

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,740
This seems like a very unconventional use

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,060
of analytics, but in 2002 a group of political science

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,600
and law academics decided to test if a model can do better

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,590
than a group of experts at predicting

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,580
the decisions of the Supreme Court.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,590
In this case, a very interpretable analytics method

10
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,340
was used, called classification and regression trees.

11
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,520
The legal system of the United States

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
operates at the state level and at

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,600
the federal or country-wide level.

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,460
The federal level is necessary to deal with cases

15
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,560
beyond the scope of state law, like disputes between states,

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,690
and violations of federal laws.

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,900
The federal court is divided into three levels--

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,590
district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court.

19
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,830
Cases start at the district courts,

20
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,480
where an initial decision is made about the case.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,310
The circuit courts hear appeals from the district courts,

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,260
and can change the decision that was made.

23
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,830
The Supreme Court is the highest level

24
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,120
in the American legal system and makes the final decision

25
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,620
on cases.

26
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,420


27
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,810
The Supreme Court of the United States

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,130
consists of nine judges, or justices,

29
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,580
who are appointed by the President.

30
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,960
This image shows the nine Supreme Court justices

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,420
from the time period 1994 through 2005.

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,310
This was the longest period of time

33
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,200
with the same set of justices in over 180 years.

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,150
The people appointed as Supreme Court justices are usually

35
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,460
distinguished judges, professors of law,

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,690
or state or federal attorneys.

37
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,870
The Supreme Court of the United States, or SCOTUS,

38
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,270
decides on the most difficult and controversial cases

39
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,300
in the United States.

40
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,810
These cases often involve an interpretation

41
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,110
of the Constitution, and have significant social, political,

42
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,315
and economic consequences.

43
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:13,020


44
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,190
There have been many significant and groundbreaking decisions

45
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,180
made by the Supreme Court.

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,610
These are a few notable decisions that were made.

47
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,500
In 1942, the Supreme Court decided

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,250
on the Wickard v. Filburn case.

49
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,360
This case recognized the power of the federal government

50
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,050
to regulate economic activity.

51
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,060
Filburn was a farmer, who was growing

52
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,510
wheat for on-farm consumption.

53
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,000
However, the US had established limits on wheat production,

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,420
and Filburn was exceeding those limits.

55
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,930
So even though the extra wheat he was producing

56
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,350
was for his own use and he had no intention of selling it,

57
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,110
he was forced to destroy it.

58
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:57,380
In 1973, the Supreme Court decided on the Roe v. Wade

59
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,470
case, one of the most well-known cases to this day.

60
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,790
They decided to legalize abortion, and by doing this,

61
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,570
prompted a national debate that continues today

62
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,680
about the legality of abortion.

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,140
In 2000, the Supreme Court actually

64
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,510
decided the outcome of the presidential election.

65
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,190
The race was so close in the state of Florida,

66
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,020
that a recount of the ballots was required.

67
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,610
But the Florida Secretary of State certified

68
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,600
that President Bush was the winner before the recount

69
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,190
could be completed.

70
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,470
The case then went to the Supreme Court

71
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,030
where it was ruled that all ballots needed to be recounted.

72
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,330
But since this could not be done before the winner had

73
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,500
to be declared, President Bush won the state of Florida,

74
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,210
and thus, the presidency.

75
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,550
A very recent case from 2012 dealt with the Patient

76
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,390
Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly

77
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,580
called ObamaCare, which requires most Americans

78
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,160
to have health insurance.

79
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,280
The Supreme Court upheld this requirement.

80
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,220


81
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,860
Since non-profits, voters, and anybody

82
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,830
interested in long-term planning can

83
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,090
benefit from knowing the outcomes of the Supreme Court

84
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,560
cases before they happen, legal academics

85
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,010
and political scientists regularly

86
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,750
make predictions of Supreme Court decisions

87
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,269
from detailed studies of the cases and individual justices.

88
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,090
In 2002, Andrew Martin, a professor

89
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,940
of political science at Washington University in St.

90
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,520
Louis, decided to instead predict

91
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,780
decisions using a statistical model built from data.

92
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,040
Together with his colleagues, he decided

93
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,170
to test the model against a panel of experts.

94
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,550
They wanted to see if an analytical model could

95
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,690
outperform the expertise and intuition

96
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,975
of a large group of experts.

97
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:48,030


98
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,150
Martin used a method called classification and regression

99
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,250
trees, or CART.

100
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,620
In this case, the outcome is binary.

101
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,650
Will the Supreme Court affirm the case or reject the case?

102
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,720
He could have used logistic regression for this,

103
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,900
but logistic regression models are not easily interpretable.

104
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,780
The model coefficients in logistic regression

105
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,600
indicate the importance and relative effect of variables,

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,900
but do not give a simple explanation

107
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,510
of how a decision is made.

108
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,660
In this lecture, we'll discuss the method of CART,

109
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,480
and a related method called random forests.

110
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,120
We will then see if these methods can actually

111
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,380
outperform experts in predicting the outcome of Supreme Court

112
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,798
cases.

113
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:33,298
