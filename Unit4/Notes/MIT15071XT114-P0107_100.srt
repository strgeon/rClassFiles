Hello.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:04,760
This week we'll be discussing the application of analytics

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,820
into very different areas-- the Supreme Court

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,740
and health care cost prediction.

5
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,850
In the first lecture, we'll discuss

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,960
how the decisions of the United States Supreme Court

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,510
can be predicted before the case even gets to the court.

8
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,060
In the second lecture, we'll discuss the story

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,500
of D2Hawkeye, a medical data-mining company I have been

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,000
involved with for several years that

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,320
use analytics to gain an edge.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,990
Through these examples, we'll introduce the method

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,260
of classification and regression trees, a very interpretable

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,700
analytics method.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,717
Let's get started.

16
00:00:40,717 --> 00:00:41,216
