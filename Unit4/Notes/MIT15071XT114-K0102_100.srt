00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,520


1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,650
Before we jump into R, let's understand the data.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,900
Each entry of this data set corresponds

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,560
to a census tract, a statistical division of the area that

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,250
is used by researchers to break down towns and cities.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,250
As a result, there will usually be multiple census tracts

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,020
per town.

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,620
LON and LAT are the longitude and latitude

8
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,740
of the center of the census tract.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,240
MEDV is the median value of owner-occupied homes, measured

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,280
in thousands of dollars.

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,650
CRIM is the per capita crime rate.

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,220
ZN is related to how much of the land

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,560
is zoned for large residential properties.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,270
INDUS is the proportion of the area used for industry.

15
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:49,920
CHAS is 1 if a census tract is next to the Charles

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,870
River, which I drew before.

17
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,860
NOX is the concentration of nitrous oxides

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,290
in the air, a measure of air pollution.

19
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,830
RM is the average number of rooms per dwelling.

20
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,530
AGE is the proportion of owner-occupied units

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,550
built before 1940.

22
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,950
DIS is a measure of how far the tract is

23
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,690
from centers of employment in Boston.

24
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,510
RAD is a measure of closeness to important highways.

25
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,560
TAX is the property tax per $10,000 of value.

26
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,070
And PTRATIO is the pupil to teacher ratio by town.

27
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,040
Let's switch over to R now.

28
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,510
So let's begin to analyze our data set with R. First of all,

29
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,880
we'll load the data set into the Boston variable.

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,770


31
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,300
If we look at the structure of the Boston data set,

32
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,880
we can see all the variables we talked about before.

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,580
There are 506 observations corresponding

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:57,050
to 506 census tracts in the Greater Boston area.

35
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,640
We are interested in building a model initially

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,280
of how prices vary by location across a region.

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,460
So let's first see how the points are laid out.

38
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:12,190
Using the plot commands, we can plot the latitude and longitude

39
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,105
of each of our census tracts.

40
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:17,852


41
00:02:17,852 --> 00:02:20,060
This picture might be a little bit meaningless to you

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,180
if you're not familiar with the Massachusetts-Boston area,

43
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,050
but I can tell you that the dense central core of points

44
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,550
corresponds to Boston city, Cambridge

45
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,700
city, and other close urban cities.

46
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,180
Still, let's try and relate it back to that picture

47
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,030
we saw in the first video, where I showed you the river

48
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,980
and where MIT was.

49
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,040
So we want to show all the points that lie along

50
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,860
the Charles River in a different color.

51
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,070
We have a variable, CHAS, that tells us

52
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,860
if a point is on the Charles River or not.

53
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,760
So to put points on an already-existing plot,

54
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,920
we can use the points command, which

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,560
looks very similar to the plot command,

56
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,560
except it operates on a plot that already exists.

57
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,520
So let's plot just the points where the Charles River

58
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,880
variable is set to one.

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:23,882


60
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:26,090
Up to now it looks pretty much like the plot command,

61
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,240
but here's where it's about to get interesting.

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,240
We can pass a color, such as blue,

63
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,050
to plot all these points in blue.

64
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,330
And this would plot blue hollow circles

65
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,030
on top of the black hollow circles.

66
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,870
Which would look all right, but I

67
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,880
think I'd much prefer to have solid blue dots.

68
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,940
To control how the points are plotted,

69
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,210
we use the pch option, which you can read about more in the help

70
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,760
documentation for the points command.

71
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,520
But I'm going to use pch 19, which

72
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,620
is a solid version of the dots we already have on our plot.

73
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,290
So by running this command, you see

74
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,470
we have some blue dots in our plot now.

75
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,917
These are the census tracts that lie along the Charles River.

76
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:08,750
But maybe it's still a little bit confusing,

77
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,820
and you'd like to know where MIT is in this picture.

78
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,470
So we can do that too.

79
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,660
I looked up which census tract MIT is in,

80
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,520
and it's census tract 3531.

81
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,000
So let's plot that.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,780
We add another point, the longitude of MIT,

83
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,520
which is in tract 3531, and the latitude of MIT,

84
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:47,040
which is in census tract 3531.

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,990
I'm going to plot this one in red,

86
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,280
so we can tell it apart from the other Charles River dots.

87
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,549
And again, I'm going to use a solid dot to do it.

88
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:59,090
Can you see it on the little picture?

89
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,422
It's a little red dot, right in the middle.

90
00:05:01,422 --> 00:05:02,880
That's exactly what we were looking

91
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,980
at from the picture in Video 1.

92
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,410
What other things can we do?

93
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,220
Well, this data set was originally constructed

94
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,000
to investigate questions about how

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,230
air pollution affects prices.

96
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,360
So the air pollution variable is this NOX variable.

97
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,020
Let's have a look at a distribution of NOX.

98
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,190


99
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,840
boston$NOX.

100
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,260
So we see that the minimum value is 0.385,

101
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,280
the maximum value is 0.87 and the median

102
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,350
and the mean are about 0.53, 0.55.

103
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,790
So let's just use the value of 0.55,

104
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,950
as it's kind of in the middle.

105
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,810
And we'll look at just the census

106
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,970
tracts that have above-average pollution.

107
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:56,200
So we'll use the points command again

108
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,550
to plot just those points.

109
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,100


110
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:07,110
So, points, the latitude--no the longitude first.

111
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,710
So we want the census tracts with NOX levels

112
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,540
greater than or equal to 0.55.

113
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,580
We want the latitude of those same census tracks.

114
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,210
Again, only if the NOX is greater than 0.55.

115
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,600
And I guess a suitable color for nasty pollution

116
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,140
would be a bright green.

117
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,280
And again, we'll use the solid dots.

118
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,530
So you can see it is pretty much the same as the other commands.

119
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,490
Wow okay.

120
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,367
So those are all the points that have got above-average pollution.

121
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,200
Looks like my office is right in the middle.

122
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,622


123
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:51,080
Now it kind of makes sense, though,

124
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,750
because that's the dense urban core of Boston.

125
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,870
If you think of anywhere where pollution would be,

126
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,830
you'd think it'd be where the most cars and the most people

127
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,330
are.

128
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,920


129
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,090
So that's kind of interesting.

130
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,242
Now, before we do anything more, we

131
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:10,450
should probably look at how prices vary over the area

132
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,430
as well.

133
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,549
So let's make a new plot.

134
00:07:14,549 --> 00:07:16,340
This one's got a few too many things on it.

135
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,240
So we'll just plot again the longitude

136
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,910
and the latitude for all census tracts.

137
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,370
That kind of resets our plot.

138
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,050
If we look at the distribution of the housing prices (boston$MEDV),

139
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:36,460
we see that the minimum price --

140
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,500
and remember the units are thousands of dollars,

141
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,740
so the median value of owner-occupied homes

142
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,350
in thousands of dollars -- so the minimum is around five,

143
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,730
the maximum is around 50.

144
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:55,759
So let's plot again only the above-average price points.

145
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,883
So we'll go:  points(boston$LON[boston$MEDV>=21.2].

146
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:20,720
We can also plot the latitude: boston$LATboston$LAT[boston$MEDV>=21.2].

147
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,615
We'll reuse that red color we used for MIT.

148
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:25,310


149
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,120
And one more time, we'll do the solid dots.

150
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,760


151
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,659
So what we see now are all the census tracts

152
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,110
with above-average housing prices.

153
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,140
As you can see, it's definitely not simple.

154
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,510
The census tracts of above-average and below-average

155
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,820
are mixed in between each other.

156
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,640
But there are some patterns.

157
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,130
For example, look at that dense black bit in the middle.

158
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,710
That corresponds to most of the city of Boston,

159
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,670
especially the southern parts of the city.

160
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,810
Also, on the Cambridge side of the river,

161
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,580
there's a big chunk there of dots that are black,

162
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,930
that are not red, that are also presumably below average.

163
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,770
So there's definitely some structure to it,

164
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,970
but it's certainly not simple in relation

165
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,420
to latitude and longitude at least.

166
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,450
We will explore this more in the next video.

167
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,434
