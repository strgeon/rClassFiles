1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:05,180
Let us discuss data sources in the health care industry.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,800
So the industry is data-rich, but data may be hard to access.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,950
Sometimes it involves unstructured data

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,280
like doctor's notes.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,660
Often the data is hard to get due to differences

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,520
in technology.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,170
Hospitals in southern Massachusetts versus California

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:32,110
might use different technologies and different platforms.

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,460
Finally there are strong privacy laws, HIPAA,

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,545
around health care data sharing.

11
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:39,420
So what is available?

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,170


13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,230
Claims data is a major source.

14
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,520
Claims data are requests for reimbursement submitted

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,780
to insurance companies or state-provided insurance

16
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,320
from doctors, hospitals and pharmacies.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,160


18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,150
Another source of data is the eligibility information

19
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,660
for employees.

20
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,320
And finally demographic information: gender and age.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,540


22
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,940
Let me give you some examples on claims data.

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,160
So this shows six different claims.

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,180
Let's consider this one.

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,560
So this is the provider's name.

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,200
The corresponding diagnostic code.

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,080
This is about upper respiratory disorders.

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,400
This is another code associated with the diagnosis.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,640
This is the scientific term for the diagnosis.

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,950
The specific code again.

31
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,620
This was an office visit, and it's an established patient.

32
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,760
The date.

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:08,460
And the amount of money that was claimed by the physician.

34
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,400
Others claims are similar.

35
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,920


36
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:22,290
As we see, the claims data is a rich, structured data source.

37
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,620
It is very high dimensional.

38
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,470
For example, claims involving diagnosis

39
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,330
involve thousands of different codes.

40
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,870
Similarly with drugs, where there are tens of thousands,

41
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,000
and procedures.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,530
However, this collection of data does not

43
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,890
capture all aspects of a person's treatment or health.

44
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,480
Many things must be inferred.

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,300
Unlike electronic medical records,

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,510
we do not know the results of a test,

47
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,660
only that the test was administered.

48
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:03,074
For example, we do not know the results of a blood test,

49
00:03:03,074 --> 00:03:05,240
but we do know that the blood test was administered.

50
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:11,060


51
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,550
The specific exercise we are going to see in this lecture

52
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:21,350
is an analytics approach to building models starting

53
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,705
with 2.4 million people over a three year span.

54
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:29,150


55
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,575
The observation period was 2001 to 2003.

56
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:36,270
This is where this data is coming from.

57
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,990
And then out of sample, we make predictions

58
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,590
for the period of 2003 and 2004.

59
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,600
This was in the early years of D2Hawkeye.

60
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,610


61
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,990
Out of the 2.4 million people, we included only people

62
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,720
with data for at least 10 months in both periods,

63
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,850
both in the observation period and the results period.

64
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,490
This decreased the data to 400,000 people.
