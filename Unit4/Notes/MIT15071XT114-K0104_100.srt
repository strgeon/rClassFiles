00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040


1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,920
Let's see how regression trees do.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,450
We'll first load the rpart library

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,550
and also load the rpart plotting library.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,800
We build a regression tree in the same way

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,400
we would build a classification tree, using the rpart command.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,390


7
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,579
We predict MEDV as a function of latitude and longitude,

8
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:26,620
using the boston dataset.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,950


10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,870
If we now plot the tree using the prp command, which

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,620
is defined in rpart.plot, we can see it makes a lot of splits

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,850
and is a little bit hard to interpret.

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,340
But the important thing is to look at the leaves.

14
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,000
In a classification tree, the leaves

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,680
would be the classification we assign

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,000
that these splits would apply to.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,930
But in regression trees, we instead predict the number.

18
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,230
That number is the average of the median house

19
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:07,080
prices in that bucket or leaf.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,160
So let's see what that means in practice.

21
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,465
So we'll plot again the latitude of the points.

22
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:18,910


23
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:25,590
And we'll again plot the points with above median prices.

24
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,180
I just scrolled up from my command history to do that.

25
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,650
Now we want to predict what the tree thinks

26
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,310
is above median, just like we did with linear regression.

27
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,035
So we'll say the fitted values we

28
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:41,460
can get from using the predict command on the tree we just

29
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:41,960
built.

30
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,070


31
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,400
And we can do another points command,

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,710
just like we did before.

33
00:01:49,710 --> 00:02:05,830
The fitted values are greater than 21.2, the color is blue,

34
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:10,090
and the character is a dollar sign.

35
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,210


36
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,730
Now we see that we've done a much better job

37
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,930
than linear regression was able to do.

38
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,840
We've correctly left the low value area in Boston

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,114
and below out, and we've correctly

40
00:02:25,114 --> 00:02:26,780
managed to classify some of those points

41
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,600
in the bottom right and top right.

42
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,270
We're still making mistakes, but we're

43
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,740
able to make a nonlinear prediction

44
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,600
on latitude and longitude.

45
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,840
So that's interesting, but the tree was very complicated.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,420
So maybe it's drastically overfitting.

47
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,230
Can we get most of this effect with a much simpler tree?

48
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,942
We can.

49
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:52,170
We would just change the minbucket size.

50
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:57,930
So let's build a new tree using the rpart command again:

51
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,800
MEDV as a function of LAT and LON, the data=boston.

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,845
But this time we'll say the minbucket size must be 50.

53
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:10,620


54
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,270
We'll use the other way of plotting trees, plot,

55
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,110
and we'll add text to the text command.

56
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,820


57
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,710
And we see we have far fewer splits,

58
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,040
and it's far more interpretable.

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,590
The first split says if the longitude

60
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,974
is greater than or equal to negative 71.07--

61
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:32,890
so if you're on the right side of the picture.

62
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,510


63
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,510
So the left-hand branch is on the left-hand side

64
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,968
of the picture and the right-hand--

65
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,810
So the left-hand side of the tree

66
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,080
corresponds to the right-hand side of the map.

67
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,830
And the right side of the tree corresponds

68
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,770
to the left side of the map.

69
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,340
That's a little bit of a mouthful.

70
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,990
Let's see what it means visually.

71
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,820
So we'll remember these values, and we'll

72
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,460
plot the longitude and latitude again.

73
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,510
So here's our map.

74
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,120
OK.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,680
So the first split was on longitude,

76
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,000
and it was negative 71.07.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,570
So there's a very handy command, "abline,"

78
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,670
which can plot horizontal or vertical lines easily.

79
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:23,070
So we're going to plot a vertical line, so v,

80
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:28,070
and we wanted to plot it at negative 71.07.

81
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,850
OK.

82
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,760
So that's that first split from the tree.

83
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,160
It corresponds to being on either the left or right-hand

84
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,910
side of this tree.

85
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:44,240
We'll plot the-- what we want to do is, we'll focus on one area.

86
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,040
We'll focus on the lowest price prediction, which

87
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,057
is in the bottom left corner of the tree,

88
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,140
right down at the bottom left after all those splits.

89
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,556
So that's where we want to get to.

90
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:57,640
So let's plot again the points.

91
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,400
Plot a vertical line.

92
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,340
The next split down towards that bottom left corner

93
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,900
was a horizontal line at 42.21.

94
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,979
So I put that in.

95
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:11,770
That's interesting.

96
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,000
So that line corresponds pretty much to where

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,940
the Charles River was from before.

98
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,600
The final split you need to get to that bottom left corner I

99
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,840
was pointing out is 42.17.

100
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,260
It was above this line.

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,810
And now that's interesting.

102
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,960
If we look at the right side of the middle of the three

103
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,970
rectangles on the right side, that

104
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,345
is the bucket we were predicting.

105
00:05:35,345 --> 00:05:38,820
And it corresponds to that rectangle, those areas.

106
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,890
That's the South Boston low price area we saw before.

107
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,360
So maybe we can make that more clear by plotting, now,

108
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,900
the high value prices.

109
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,210
So let's go back up to where we plotted all the red dots

110
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,700
and overlay it.

111
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,470
So this makes it even more clear.

112
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,510
We've correctly shown how the regression tree carves out

113
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,120
that rectangle in the bottom of Boston

114
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,460
and says that is a low value area.

115
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,649
So that's actually very interesting.

116
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:13,690
It's shown us something that regression trees can

117
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,898
do that we would never expect linear regression to be

118
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:16,889
able to do.

119
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:19,180
So the question we're going to answer in the next video

120
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,604
is given that regression trees can do these fancy things

121
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:24,020
with latitude and longitude, is it

122
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,895
actually going to help us to be able to build

123
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:28,220
a predictive model, predicting house prices?

124
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,380
Well, we'll have to see.

125
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,626
