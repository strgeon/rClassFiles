1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:04,070
This is a story of D2Hawkeye, a medical data mining

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:09,720
company located in Waltham, Massachusetts.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,790
The company was founded by Chris Kryder, a medical doctor who

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,940
was an MIT physician in the 1990s.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,820
The company was founded in 2001.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,530
I have been in the board of this company since 2002.

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,730
The company combines expert knowledge

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,110
and databases with analytics to improve quality and course

9
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,120
management in health care.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,670
The company was located in Waltham, Massachusetts.

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:46,950
It grew very fast and was sold to Verisk Analytics in 2009.

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,240
The overall process that D2Hawkeye uses is as follows.

13
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,700
It starts with medical claims that

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:02,630
consist of diagnoses, procedures, and drugs.

15
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:07,350
These medical claims are then processed

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:13,150
via process of aggregation, cleaning, and normalization.

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,340
This data then enters secure databases

18
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,450
on which predictive models are applied.

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,600
The output of predictive models are specific reports

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,940
that give insight to the various questions

21
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,775
that D2Hawkeye aspires to answer.

22
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:40,790


23
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:45,330
The company tries to improve health care case management.

24
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:51,440
Specifically, it tries to identify high-risk patients,

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,410
work with patients to manage treatment and associated costs,

26
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,180
and arrange specialist care.

27
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,320


28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,780
Medical costs, of course, is a serious matter

29
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,300
both for the patient as well as the provider.

30
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,180
Being able to predict this cost is an important problem

31
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,170
that interests both the patients as well as the providers.

32
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,520
The overall goal of D2Hawkeye is to improve

33
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,150
the quality of cost predictions.

34
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,230
D2Hawkeye had many different types of clients.

35
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,400
The most important were third party administrators

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,880
of medical claims.

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,000
Third party administrators are companies

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,240
hired by the employer who manage the claims of the employees.

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,320
Now the type of clients were case management companies,

40
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,120
benefits consultants, and health plans.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,450
The company grew and by 2009, it analyzed monthly millions

42
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,040
of people through the analytic platform it built.

43
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,830
This corresponded to thousands of employers

44
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,050
that were processed monthly.

45
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,630


46
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,860
To analyze the data, the company used

47
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,440
what we call a pre-analytics approach.

48
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,200
This was based on the human judgment of physicians

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,670
who manually analyze patient histories and developed

50
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,620
medical rules.

51
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,970
Of course, this involved human judgment,

52
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,850
utilized a limited set of data, it

53
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,400
was often costly, and somewhat inefficient.

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,840
The key question we analyze in this lecture

55
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,266
is "Can we use analytics instead?"

56
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:45,766
