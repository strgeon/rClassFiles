1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,760
Let us introduce the error measures

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,360
we used in building the analytics models.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,435
We of course used R squared, but we also used other measures.

4
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:15,550


5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,570
Next measure, the so-called "penalty error,"

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,420
is motivated by the fact that if you classify

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,600
a very high-risk patient as a low-risk patient,

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,300
this is more costly than the reverse,

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,823
namely classifying a low-risk patient

10
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:31,989
as a very high-risk patient.

11
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:35,410


12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,200
Motivated by this, we developed a penalty error.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,050
And the idea is to use asymmetric penalties.

14
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,380
The graph here-- shows a matrix--

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,880
where this is the outcome and this is the forecast.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:59,260
For example, whenever we classify a low-risk patient

17
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,820
as high-risk, we pay a penalty of 2,

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,720
which is a difference of 3 minus 1, the difference in the error.

19
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:17,250
But inversely, when you classify a bucket 3 patient

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,340
as bucket 1 patient, this is double.

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,150
The cost-- the penalty-- is double the amount.

22
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:30,340
So you observe that the off diagonal penalties are double

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,860
the corresponding penalties in the lower diagonal.

24
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,790


25
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,865
To judge the quality of the analytics models we developed,

26
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:44,440
we compare it with a baseline.

27
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,105
And the baseline is to simply predict

28
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:48,150
that the cost in the next "period"

29
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,850
will be the cost in the current period.

30
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,170
We have observed that as far as identification of buckets

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,120
is concerned, the accuracy was 75%.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:06,830
So namely, whenever we predict that the risk is bucket 3--

33
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,419
indeed it is bucket 3-- this happens 75% of the time,

34
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,600
and the penalty error-- the average penalty

35
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:16,190
error of the baseline-- was 0.56.

36
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,811
