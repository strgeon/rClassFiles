00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,200
So can a CART model actually predict Supreme Court case

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,220
outcomes better than a group of experts?

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,550
Martin and his colleagues used 628 previous Supreme Court

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,790
cases between 1994 and 2001 to build their model.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,470
They made predictions for the 68 cases

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,840
that would be decided in October, 2002,

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,310
before the term started.

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,340
Their model had two stages of CART trees.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,160
The first stage involved making predictions

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,900
using two CART trees.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,420
One to predict a unanimous liberal decision and one

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,700
to predict a unanimous conservative decision.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:44,060
If the trees gave conflicting responses or both predicted no,

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,600
then they moved on to the next stage.

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,220
It turns out that about 50% of Supreme Court cases

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,550
result in a unanimous decision,

17
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,970
so this was a nice first step to detect the easier cases.

18
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,600
The second stage consisted of predicting

19
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,760
the decision of each individual justice,

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,340
and then use the majority decision of all nine justices

21
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,180
as a final prediction for the case.

22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,610
In this lecture, we constructed the CART tree

23
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,540
for Justice Stevens.

24
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,320
Here's a different tree, this one for Justice O'Connor.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,170
The first split is whether or not

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,390
the lower court decision is liberal.

27
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,250
If yes, then we predict that she will reverse the case.

28
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,360
This makes sense because Justice O'Connor is generally

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,170
viewed as a conservative judge.

30
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,880
On the other hand, if the lower court decision is conservative,

31
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,010
we check for the circuit court of origin.

32
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,440
If it's the second, third, DC, or federal court,

33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,660
we predict that she will affirm the case.

34
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,730
If it's not one of these courts, we move on to the next split.

35
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,170
The remaining two splits are for the respondent

36
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,520
and the primary issue.

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,100
Here's another tree, this one for Justice Souter.

38
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,830
This shows an unusual property of the CART trees

39
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,510
that Martin and his colleagues developed.

40
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,970
They use predictions for some trees

41
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,389
as independent variables for other trees.

42
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,120
In this tree, the first split is whether or not

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,860
Justice Ginsburg's predicted decision is liberal.

44
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,190
So we have to run Justice Ginsburg's CART tree first,

45
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,080
see what the prediction is,

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,930
and then use that as input for Justice Souter's tree.

47
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,690
If Justice Ginsburg's predicted decision is liberal

48
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,330
and the lower court decision is liberal,

49
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,610
then we predict that Justice Souter will affirm the case.

50
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,610
But if the lower court decision is conservative,

51
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,430
then we predict that Justice Souter will reverse the case.

52
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,530
On the other side of the tree, if Justice Ginsburg's

53
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,020
predicted decision is conservative,

54
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,660
but the lower court decision is liberal,

55
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,390
then we predict that Justice Souter will reverse the case.

56
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,770
But if the lower court decision is conservative,

57
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,520
then we predict that Justice Souter will affirm the case.

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,650
In summary, if we predict that Justice Ginsburg will

59
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,460
make a liberal decision, then Justice Souter

60
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:12,620
will probably make a liberal decision too.

61
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,930
But if we predict that Justice Ginsburg will

62
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,320
make a conservative decision, then we

63
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,270
predict that Justice Souter will probably

64
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,330
make a conservative decision too.

65
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:24,720


66
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,520
Martin and his colleagues also recruited 83 legal experts,

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,210
71 academics, and 12 attorneys.

68
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,430
38 had previously clerked for a Supreme Court Justice,

69
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,660
33 were chaired professors, and five

70
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,340
were current or former law school deans.

71
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,840
So this was really a dream team of experts.

72
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,910
Additionally, the experts were only

73
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,540
asked to predict within their area of expertise.

74
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,470
So not all experts predicted all cases,

75
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,010
but there was more than one expert making predictions

76
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,220
for each case.

77
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,460
When making their predictions, the experts

78
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,620
were allowed to consider any source of information,

79
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,430
but they were not allowed to communicate

80
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,140
with each other regarding the predictions.

81
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,580
For the 68 cases in October 2002,

82
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,890
the predictions were made, and at the end of the month

83
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,010
the results were computed.

84
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,899
For predicting the overall decision that

85
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,430
was made by the Supreme Court, the models

86
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,240
had an accuracy of 75%, while the experts only

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,980
had an accuracy of 59%.

88
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,120
So the models had a significant edge over the experts

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,450
in predicting the overall case outcomes.

90
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,920
However, when the predictions were

91
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,820
run for individual justices, the model and the experts

92
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,950
performed very similarly.

93
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,700
For some justices, the model performed better,

94
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:52,070
and for some justices, the experts performed better.

95
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,660
Being able to predict Supreme Court decisions

96
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,840
is very valuable to firms, politicians,

97
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,830
and non-governmental organizations.

98
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,180
We saw in this lecture that a model that

99
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,720
predicts overall Supreme Court decisions is both more

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,650
accurate than experts and can be run much faster than experts

101
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,810
can make their predictions.

102
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,420
The CART models that we built were

103
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,060
based on very high level components of the cases,

104
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,880
compared to the experts who can process

105
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,520
much more detailed and complex information.

106
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,660
This example really shows the edge

107
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,170
that analytics can provide in traditionally qualitative

108
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,522
applications.

109
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:31,022
