Hi.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,080
This is Iain, and welcome to the recitation

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,797
for the visualization week.

4
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,630
Today, we're going to be discussing examples

5
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,410
of good and bad visualizations, and then discussing

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,180
how to make better versions using our R skills.

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,520
Remember, visualization is an art form,

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,100
and it's inherently subjective.

9
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,433
You should try to form your own opinions on the material

10
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:19,380
as we go through it.

11
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,430
So let's get started.

00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,080
