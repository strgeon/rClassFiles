1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,600
In this video, we'll discuss how we can create visualizations

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,490
that are used in predictive policing models.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,430
In almost every application, before we even

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,980
consider a predictive model, we should

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,560
try to understand the historical data.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,340
Many cities in the United States and around the world,

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,260
provide logs of reported crimes, usually the time, location,

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,640
and nature of the event.

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,350
In this lecture, we'll use data from the city of Chicago,

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,810
in the United States, about motor vehicle thefts.

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,400


12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,820
Given this data on crimes, suppose

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,950
we wanted to communicate crime patterns

14
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,560
over the course of an average week.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,690
We could display daily crime averages using a line graph,

16
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,030
like the one shown here, but this doesn't seem too useful.

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,960
We can see that crime tends to be higher on Saturday, but when

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,400
on Saturday, and where?

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,830
We could replace our x-axis with the hour of the day

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,780
and have a different line for every day of the week

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,760
to understand when crime occurs in more detail.

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,150
But this would be a jumbled mess with seven lines, and probably

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,150
very hard to read.

24
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,660
We could instead use no visualization at all,

25
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,810
and instead present information in a table,

26
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,040
like the one shown here.

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,650
For each hour and day, we have the total number

28
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,240
of crimes that occurred.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,030
This is a valid representation of the data,

30
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,460
but large tables of numbers can be hard to read and understand.

31
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,590
So how can we make the table more interesting and usable?

32
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,210


33
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,700
A great way to visualize information

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,550
in a two-dimensional table is with a heat map.

35
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,050
Heat maps visualize data using three attributes.

36
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,030
Two of the attributes are on the x and y-axes, typically

37
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,990
displayed horizontally and vertically.

38
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,400
The third attribute is represented by shades of color.

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,930
In this example, lower values in the third attribute

40
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,780
correspond to colors closer to blue,

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,280
and higher values in the third attribute

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,780
correspond to colors closer to red.

43
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,926
For example, the x-axis could be hours of the day,

44
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:28,910
the y-axis could be days of the week,

45
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,020
and the colors could correspond to the amount of crime.

46
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,630


47
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,000
In a heat map, we can pick different color schemes

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,150
based on the type of data to convey different messages.

49
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,560
In crime, a yellow to red color scheme

50
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,410
might be appropriate because it can highlight

51
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,230
some of the more dangerous areas in red.

52
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,760
Your eye is naturally drawn to the red areas of the plot.

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,380
In other applications, both high and low values

54
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:03,050
are meaningful, so having a more varied color scheme

55
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,180
might be useful.

56
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,340
And in other applications, you might only

57
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,970
want to see cells with high values,

58
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,550
so you could use a gray scale to make the cells with low values

59
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,382
white.

60
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:20,360
The x and y-axes in a heat map don't need to be continuous.

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,687
In our example, we have a categorical or factor variable

62
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:25,964
-- the day of the week.

63
00:03:25,964 --> 00:03:28,840
And we can even combine a heat map

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,080
with a geographical map, which we'll

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,660
discuss later in this lecture.

66
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,030
This type of heat map is frequently used

67
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:42,100
in predictive policing to show crime hot spots in a city.

68
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,400
In this lecture, we'll use Chicago motor vehicle theft

69
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,120
data to explore patterns of crime, both over days

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,130
of the week, and over hours of the day.

71
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,880
We're interested in analyzing the total number of car thefts

72
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,475
that occur in any particular hour

73
00:03:59,475 --> 00:04:03,420
of a day of the week over our whole data set.

74
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,280
In the next video, we'll switch to R,

75
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,390
and start by creating a basic line

76
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,890
plot counting the total crime by the day of the week.
