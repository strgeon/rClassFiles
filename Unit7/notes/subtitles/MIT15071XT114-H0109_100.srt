00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,890
The good, the bad, and the ugly.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:07,540
This is a recitation for the visualization week.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,570
With great power comes great responsibility.

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,580
There are many ways to visualize the same data.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,210
You have just seen how to make quite attractive visualizations

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:20,590
with ggplot2, which has good default settings,

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,230
but judgment is still required from the user.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,860
For example, do I decide to vary the size of a point

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,810
or do I vary the color of a point?

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,960
It is worth noting at this point that Excel

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,670
and other similar programs can also

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,810
be used to make perfectly acceptable visualizations,

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,560
or terrible ones.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,150
The tool can help, but it's ultimately up to the user

15
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,040
to make decisions.

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,290
So what is the difference between a good visualization

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,020
and a bad visualization then?

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,430
I would argue that a good visualization

19
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,570
clearly and accurately conveys the key messages in the data.

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,740
A bad visualization will obfuscate the data either

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,020
through ignorance or malice.

22
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,480
So what does this mean?

23
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,850
Visualizations can be used by an analyst

24
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,180
for their own consumption to gain insights into the data.

25
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,370
Visualizations can also be used to provide information

26
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,150
to a decision maker and/or to convince someone of something.

27
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,060
Now, a bad visualization can hide

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:26,766
patterns that could give insight or mislead decision makers.

29
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:28,390
This is where the malice part comes in.

30
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,310


31
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,640
So today, we will look at a few examples of visualizations

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,200
taken from a variety of sources.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,530
We'll discuss what is good and what is bad about them.

34
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,490
Then we will switch into R to build better versions of them

35
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,540
for ourselves.

36
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,434
But I want you to think for yourself in this recitation.

37
00:01:49,434 --> 00:01:51,350
You might not agree with all the points I make

38
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,990
or my opinions about these visualizations.

39
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,890
Visualization is inherently subjective

40
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,750
and the right visualization will depend on the situation.

41
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,930
So use your own judgment and think

42
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,675
about what I talked about before with a good visualization

43
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:07,920
and a bad visualization.
