1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,350
This week, we'll be discussing the power of visualizations

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,950
for understanding worldwide trends

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,970
and for using analytics to stop crime.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,310
In the first lecture, we'll use data from the World Health

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,129
Organization to create visualizations

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:18,790
that help us understand and communicate

7
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,410
global health trends.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,070
In the second lecture, we'll discuss predictive policing,

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,810
and how police departments across the country

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,180
are using data and analytics to improve decision making.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,980
Through these examples, we'll create visualizations in R

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,560
that help us understand our data and our models.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,530
Let's get started.

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,110
