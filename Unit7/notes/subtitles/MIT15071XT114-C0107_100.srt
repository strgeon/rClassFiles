1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,930
Let me comment on the merits of heatmaps

2
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:06,710
as a way of representing data in the context of representing

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,660
crime activity.

4
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,350
Criminal activity-related data often

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,200
has both components of time and location.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,880
Sometimes, all that is required is a line chart,

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,180
but heatmaps can visualize data that

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,190
will be too big for a table.

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,075
Plotting data on maps is much more effective

10
00:00:24,075 --> 00:00:29,900
than a table for location based data, and is eye catching.

11
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,560
What is the edge of predictive policing?

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,970
Many police forces are exploiting their databases

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,020
to focus finite resources on problem areas.

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,720
Not only do analytics help improve policework,

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,940
the outputs are also good communication tools

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,590
to decision makers in government, and the wider

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,690
public.

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,210
The application of analytics to data like this

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,180
is new and growing, with companies

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,790
like PredPol and Palantir leading the effort.
