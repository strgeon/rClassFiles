1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,480
In this lecture, we'll discuss the idea of using visualization

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,970
to better understand data and to provide insights

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,240
on the problem we're addressing.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,870
Why visualization?

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,450
People often say that a picture is like a thousand words.

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,120
In the same spirit, John Tukey, a major statistician

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,290
at Princeton, wrote that "the picture-examining eye

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,610
is the best finder we have of the wholly unanticipated."

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,170
Visualizing data allows us to discern relationships,

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,940
structures, distributions, outliers, patterns, behaviors,

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,260
dependencies, and outcomes.

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,980
Visualization is further useful for initial data exploration,

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,200
for interpreting models, and for communicating results

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,640
effectively.

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,440
Let us give some examples of different modes

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,380
of visualization that illustrate these points.

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,960
The figure shows the miles per gallon

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,099
of a car as a function of the car's weight.

19
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,320
The figure clearly illustrates that as the weight of the car

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,220
increases, the miles per gallon decrease.

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,250
The same graph, but now colors of the points

22
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,340
signify the number of cylinders in the car: four for red,

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,760
six for green, and eight in blue.

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,160


25
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,450
On the same data, we now plot a regression line

26
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,670
that captures the intuition that as the weight of the car

27
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,770
increases, the miles per gallon decrease.

28
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,190
In this plot, we'll visualize burglaries

29
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,770
in the city of Houston by combining data and geographical

30
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,950
location in a map.

31
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,210
This plot illustrates, using a heat map,

32
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,500
the usage of rented bicycles from the Hubway company.

33
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,460
The horizontal axis is the hour of the day,

34
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,500
and the vertical axis the day of the week, starting on Sunday.

35
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,520
The heat map shows that the usage increases

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,915
during the morning and night rush hours on weekdays.

37
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:16,570


38
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,550
The next plot helps us visualize histograms

39
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:25,250
of different categories using the Hubway data.

40
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,520
This plot shows US unemployment by state.

41
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,990
The lighter colors corresponding to smaller unemployment,

42
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,270
and the darker colors corresponding

43
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,815
to larger unemployment rates.

44
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:41,140


45
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,630
The plan this week is to create all of these visualizations.

46
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,340
We'll see how visualizations can be used to better understand

47
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,870
data, communicate information more effectively,

48
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,670
show the results of analytical models.

49
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,810
In the next video, we'll discuss the World Health Organization,

50
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,850
and how they use visualizations effectively.
