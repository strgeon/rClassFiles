1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:04,140
In this video, we're going to look at scales.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,260
This first plot shows the average height

3
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:09,980
of a 21-year-old male in centimeters.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:16,309
The x-axis is time, starting in 1871, and ending in 1975.

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,270
Each person represents the height,

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,320
at a different point in time, and the points are evenly

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,530
spaced in time, so the x-axis is OK.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,820
The y-axis ranges from just under 160 to 180 centimeters,

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,030
which isn't inherently bad, but does overstate the change.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,216
The real problem is the bars.

11
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:38,590
If it was accurate, we would only

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,940
really see the heads of the men, but instead we

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,770
see their whole bodies, making it seem as if people have not

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,320
only doubled in height, but they've also double in width.

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,440


16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,590
This next plot also has issues with scale.

17
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,850
The total range of the plot is 8% to 10%,

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,360
although all the numbers fall in the range of 8.6% to 9.2%.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,499
If we plotted the y-axis on a 0% to 10% scale,

20
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,520
the conclusion would be that nothing is really

21
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
changing at all.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,190
The last point in the chart is at the wrong height,

23
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,810
and the size of the markers makes the relative locations

24
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,860
hard to distinguish.

25
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,770
Also notice that the gap between 9.0% and the 8.9% markers

26
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,820
on the far left side, and the 8.9% and 8.8% markers,

27
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,790
have a different gap.

28
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,550
This plot shows the relative breakdown of teachers

29
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,430
by race in a certain teaching program.

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,560
The Caucasian bar is truncated, which is a risky choice,

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,760
but could be appropriate in some situations.

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,620
A much bigger problem is that the scale of each blue bar

33
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,500
is entirely different.

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,450
For example, the Native American bar is about a third

35
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,775
of the length of the African American bar,

36
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:54,680
but there are more than 10 times as many African Americans

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,170
in this program as Native Americans.

38
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:00,860
In fact, visually, this plot is completely meaningless.

39
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,960
The only useful thing about it is the numbers.

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,750
But even there, there is a bit of confusion,

41
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:09,020
as Native Americans are given to one decimal place,

42
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,470
but the others are rounded.

43
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,820
Which when combined with the confusing scales,

44
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,800
casts doubt on the correctness of the numbers.

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,950


46
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,300
Here is a before and after of the same data.

47
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,930
On the left, we see the US military expense

48
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,530
in the right axis, and troop count on the left axis.

49
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,890
Both the line and bar plots are individually OK,

50
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,280
but the combination is misleading.

51
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,394
Because you have mixed two units, dollars and people,

52
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:39,060
there is a false impression of some sort

53
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,850
of crossover point in 1995 that does not exist.

54
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,650
On the right is the same data presented in a different way.

55
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,430
We now have troops on the x-axis,

56
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,710
and dollars on the y-axis.

57
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,740
The line moves through time now, allowing

58
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,990
us to see when moments of change occurred, such as decreases

59
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,510
in troop count, through the 90s, at the end of the Cold War,

60
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,690
the increase in spending of the 2000s,

61
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,850
and the recent decreases in military spending.

62
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,500
The final visualization I want to show you today

63
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,280
is all about the different types of household.

64
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,280
The US Census Bureau periodically

65
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,905
determines how many households are comprised, for example,

66
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,560
of married couples with and without children,

67
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,320
people living alone, and so on.

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,730
First of all, I'm not saying this is a bad visualization.

69
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,280
In fact, if we are interested in the relative share

70
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,370
of each type of household in a particular year,

71
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,620
it's actually pretty good.

72
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,630
However, if what we're interested in

73
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,940
is the rates of change across the years,

74
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,010
this is next to useless.

75
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,790
The key problem is that the x-axis is completely off.

76
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,690
The gap between the first two columns is 10 years,

77
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,590
but the gap between the last two columns

78
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,090
is only 2 years, meaning that the rates are

79
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,150
hard to read from this.

80
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,515
If we're not interested in the rates of changes,

81
00:03:56,515 --> 00:04:00,920
but just want to compare two years at a time, it's not bad,

82
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,070
but it's not easy either.

83
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,170
Try comparing 1970 married without children

84
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,100
to 2010 married without children,

85
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,250
without looking at the numbers.

86
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,100
Can you tell if it has grown or shrunk?

87
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,490
Finally, and more generally, this chart

88
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,500
shows relative numbers.

89
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,380
If you look at absolute numbers, we

90
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,530
might find the total number of couples married with children

91
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,560
is actually constant, but the number of other households

92
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,350
has increased.

93
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,140
We are now going to change into R

94
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,350
to try plotting this data as a line chart.
