1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,280
So we just made this plot in ggplot2.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,070
When we compare it back to the pie graph,

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,050
the first thing I notice is that now all the data is visible.

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:11,840
We haven't lost the small regions

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,840
and we can read out the exact share that

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,940
comes from Africa, Oceania, and the unknown or stateless

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,400
column.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,660
I believe it is also easier to compare the relative sizes

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,530
of each region because they're all

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,525
put side by side on a similar scale.

11
00:00:27,525 --> 00:00:29,150
There's no tricks, or three dimensions,

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:33,350
or colors to create a perception issue.

13
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,520
But, I will say that something to consider

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,020
is, for some people and some applications,

15
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:42,190
being not as visually exciting is a negative.

16
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,620
This plot, while very readable and correct,

17
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,626
is certainly a little bit dull.

18
00:00:47,626 --> 00:00:50,000
In some applications, this is an important consideration.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,790


20
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,220
Now, wouldn't it be interesting if we

21
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,130
could plot this data on a world map?

22
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,000
It would be possible, but a bit tedious

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,950
to create because we need to determine

24
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,000
which country lies in which region.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,530
Shading all countries in a region of the same color

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,560
might be misleading though.

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,040
For example, countries in Latin America

28
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,440
will send students at different rates, naturally.

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,270
But, if we color them all the same color,

30
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:20,810
it kind of gives a false impression.

31
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,600
As it turns out, we actually have access

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,780
to per country data.

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,560
So we will plot that on a world map

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,300
instead and see if it is an effective way of communicating

35
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,100
where students come from to MIT.
