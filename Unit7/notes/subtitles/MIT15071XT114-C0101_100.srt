1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,130
In this lecture, we will discuss how visualization

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,110
can offer insights in the area of policing

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,740
in urban environments.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,780
The explosion of computerized data

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,130
affects all parts of society, including policing.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,930
In the past, human judgment and experience

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,510
was the only tool in identifying patterns in criminal behavior.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,455
Police forces around the United States and the world

9
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:28,390
are augmenting human judgment with analytics.

10
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,400
Los Angeles police worked for months

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,590
to catch Manson and his followers.

12
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,480
These days the LAPD is on an offensive to prevent crime.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,950
Its latest weapon is a computer program

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,940
that can actually predict where crimes will happen.

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,700
And justice correspondent Bob Orr

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,840
has a first look at the results.

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,130
In the Foothill Division north of downtown Los Angeles,

18
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,590
police are patrolling the largely

19
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,150
working-class neighborhoods with specially marked maps.

20
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,550
The small red squares are hot spots,

21
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,080
where computers project property crimes are most likely.

22
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,330
It's called predictive policing.

23
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,010
A program which Captain Sean Malinowski says

24
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,500
puts officers on the scene before crimes occur.

25
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,350
65% of our crimes are burglary, grand theft auto,

26
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,980
and burglary for motor vehicle.

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,810
And that's what these boxes represent.

28
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,840
That's a pretty small box, 500 feet by 500 feet.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,410
Yes, it is a small area.

30
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,540
These crime prediction boxes come

31
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,390
from the same kind of mathematical calculation used

32
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,300
to predict earthquakes and aftershocks.

33
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,030
By analyzing the times, dates, and places of recent crimes

34
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,200
computers project hot spots for burglaries, break-ins, and car

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,490
thefts.

36
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,770
LA's Police Chief Charlie Beck says

37
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,900
increasing police patrols inside those boxes

38
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,920
denies criminals opportunity.

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,200
The real measure of this is not how many people you catch,

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,200
it's how much crime you prevent.

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,600
I love catching people.

42
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,800
It's what I live for.

43
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,100
But, what I'd rather do is live in a place and work in a place

44
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,390
where crime didn't happen.

45
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,260
Chief Beck, a 35-year veteran and the father of two LAPD

46
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,830
officers, has faced some skepticism

47
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,080
in selling the predictive concept.

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,987
You're a street cop.

49
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:12,120
I am.

50
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,950
So somebody comes to you with a computer program that says,

51
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,700
here we're going to predict the future,

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,080
we're going to tell you where crime is going to occur.

53
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,510
Aren't some of the guys on the street just going

54
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,420
to roll their eyes and say, oh come on?

55
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,170
Well, of course.

56
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,920
I mean, that's the nature of human beings.

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,350
I mean everybody thinks that they do their profession as

58
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,850
well as it can be done already, so they don't need any help.

59
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,240
If this old street cop can change the way

60
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,230
that he thinks about this stuff, then I

61
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,460
know that my kids can do the same.

62
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,860
The LAPD began testing the predictive policing model here

63
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,090
in the Foothill Division in November,

64
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,580
and the early results are encouraging.

65
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:52,170
Burglaries are down 33%, and violent crime is also down 21%.

66
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,920
That success will allow Beck to expand the program

67
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,747
to other parts of the city and leverage limited resources.

68
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:00,080
I'm not going to get more money.

69
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,820
I'm not going to get more cops.

70
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,100
But I have to be better at using what I have,

71
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,260
and that's what predictive policing is about.

72
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,400
It's also about driving the crime rate lower.

73
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,060
Crime here has dropped nine straight years.

74
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:17,380
With these small red boxes, LA is aiming for 10.

75
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,800
Bob Orr, CBS News, Los Angeles.

76
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,590
The Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck

77
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,310
writes, "I'm not going to get more money.

78
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,260
I'm not going to get more cops.

79
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,860
I have to be better at using what I have,

80
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,360
and that's what predictive policing is about.

81
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,200
If this old street cop can change the way

82
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,580
that he thinks about this stuff, then I

83
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,450
know that my officers can do the same."

84
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,050
Let me comment on the role of analytics.

85
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,600
The analytical tools you have learned in this class

86
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,780
can be used to make these predictive policing models

87
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,700
possible.

88
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,820
However, communicating the results of these models

89
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,970
is critical.

90
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,590
A linear regression output table will not

91
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,500
be of use to a police person on patrol.

92
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,460
Visualization bridges the gap between the analytics

93
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,380
and the end user.
