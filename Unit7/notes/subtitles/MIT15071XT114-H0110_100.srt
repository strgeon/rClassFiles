1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,715
There are a lot of visualizations in the world

2
00:00:02,715 --> 00:00:04,640
and we don't have time for them all.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,620
So let's focus on one particularly abused plot

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,780
type, the pie chart.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,160
We have a specimen right here.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,982
This is a pie chart of phone application crashes,

7
00:00:14,982 --> 00:00:16,790
showing what percentage of all crashes

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,710
took place in each mobile operating system.

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,260
This data set contains information

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,570
for all versions of Apple's iOS, which is used in the iPhone,

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,839
as well as the various versions of Google's Android.

12
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:30,630
There are many things wrong with this plot,

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,105
but let's break down exactly what.

14
00:00:33,105 --> 00:00:35,230
Putting aside, for a moment, that there are far too

15
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,950
many labels, check out the ordering of the labels

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,670
corresponding to iOS.

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,260
Two sensible ways of ordering iOS data

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,750
might be by decreasing percentage

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,880
or by version number.

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,050
Instead, we start at the top with iOS 3.13, with 0%,

21
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,090
and then jump to iOS 4.2.10, with 12.64%,

22
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:04,050
before going back down to iOS 3.2, with 0.00% again.

23
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,517
Which brings us to the number of labels.

24
00:01:06,517 --> 00:01:08,350
Many of the segments are so narrow that they

25
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,200
can't be seen, although technically, all data is

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,100
retained, because every segment is labeled.

27
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,080
If we look at iOS, we see that there

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,090
are only three major versions, 3, 4, and 5, suggesting

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,970
we can compress down the iOS segments to just three

30
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,744
segments, while retaining most of the information.

31
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:29,160
At the least, the versions that differ in the third number

32
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,240
should be combined, and all data points of 0% should be removed.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,464
The more fundamental concern of this visualization

34
00:01:36,464 --> 00:01:37,880
is that it might really be showing

35
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,296
the percentage of the phone market

36
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:42,460
using each operating system, and says nothing about whether one

37
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,730
operating system crashes more than the other, which

38
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,190
is the focus of this visualization.

39
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,420
Our next pie chart has its own share of problems.

40
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,745
This is a plot of how many shark attacks have

41
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,890
been attributed to each type of shark.

42
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,050
Firstly, the pie chart is, for some reason,

43
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,780
plotted on a hemisphere, a graphical effect that

44
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,710
adds nothing, but has the effect of vertically compressing

45
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,660
the pie chart.

46
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,639
Next, there is the issue of label orientation.

47
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,370
While the caption, "Shark species (total/deaths)",

48
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,840
and the label, "White shark", are horizontal,

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,570
the rest are vertical and hard to read.

50
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,330
They are in order, however, which does help.

51
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,190
Although the "Others" segment is unfortunately large,

52
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,240
which is unclear if it is due to there being a lot of attacks

53
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,570
by many species, or if the species is not

54
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,580
known for many attacks.

55
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,090
Finally, at a glance, it is hard to distinguish

56
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,030
the magnitude of differences between the orange, green,

57
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,250
blue, and brown segments in the top part of the pie chart,

58
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,770
and we must resort to the labels to distinguish between them.

59
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,380
There is no meaning in the colors, they are arbitrary.

60
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,790
Finally, we'll look at a pie chart I made,

61
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,440
of the origins of the international students at MIT.

62
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,370
I made this chart with the default settings

63
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,430
in Google Sheets.

64
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,090
First of all, not all of the segments

65
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,945
are labeled, so that data is lost,

66
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:03,680
for the Middle East, Africa, Oceania,

67
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,940
and the unknown regions.

68
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,460
Second, again, we have colors that are arbitrary and almost

69
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,090
close enough to be confusing.

70
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,940
The difference between Asia and Africa's colors is subtle.

71
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,005
And of course, the 3D-effect on the pie

72
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:20,626
chart adds nothing, but does play a subtle trick on the eye.

73
00:03:20,626 --> 00:03:23,210
Due to the 3D-effect, the blue and red segments

74
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,990
are actually larger looking, which at a glance,

75
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:29,730
may lead the viewer to overestimate their size.

76
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,150
What we are going to do now is, switch over to R

77
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,690
and plot this data more appropriately, using ggplot.

78
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,190
And then we'll return to the slides,

79
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,670
to discuss some more possibilities for this data.
