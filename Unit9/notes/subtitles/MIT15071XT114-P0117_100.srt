1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,750
This week, we'll see how optimization

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:05,340
can be used to find a sports schedule

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:08,500
and to find a perfect match in online dating.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,640
In the first lecture, we'll discuss

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,860
how almost every single sports league uses optimization

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,270
to design their season schedules.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,565
We'll extend the idea of linear optimization

8
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:21,700
to integer optimization, a powerful way

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,600
to model decisions.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,290
In the second lecture, we'll talk

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,060
about how eHarmony, the online dating site,

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,370
combines predictive models with optimization models

13
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,330
to suggest matches.

14
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:35,350
Let's get started.
