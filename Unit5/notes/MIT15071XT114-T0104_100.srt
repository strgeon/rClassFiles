00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,140
When Watson receives a question, the first step

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,670
is question analysis.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,080
One of the things Watson tries to figure out in this step

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,210
is what the question is looking for.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,620
This is defined as trying to find the Lexical Answer

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,300
Type, or LAT, of the question.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,280
The LAT is the word or noun in the question

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,470
that specifies the type of answer.

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,720
You should be able to replace the LAT with the answer

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,850
to complete the sentence.

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,580
For example, for the question, "Mozart's last

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,770
and perhaps most powerful symphony

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,680
shares its name with this planet," the LAT in this case

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,370
is "this planet."

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,380
If we replace this with the answer "Jupiter,"

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,920
it makes sense.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,570
Mozart's last and perhaps most powerful symphony shares

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,120
its name with Jupiter.

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,270
For the question, "Smaller than only Greenland,

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,910
it's the world's second largest island," the LAT is "it's."

21
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,269
If we replace the LAT with the answer "New Guinea,"

22
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:06,650
it makes sense.

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,120
"Smaller than only Greenland, New Guinea

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,850
is the world's second largest island."

25
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,220
Unfortunately, the LAT is not "island,"

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,520
which would be more descriptive, since the sentence with "New

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,160
Guinea" in place of "island" does not make sense.

28
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,980
We can see in these two examples that sometimes the LAT is very

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,630
specific, like "this planet," and sometimes it's very vague,

30
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,880
like "it's."

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,460
If we know the LAT, we know what to look for.

32
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,420
However, in an analysis of 20,000 questions,

33
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,360
2,500 distinct LATs were found, and 12% of the questions

34
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,680
did not even have an explicit LAT.

35
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,360
They had LATs like "it's."

36
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,790
Furthermore, even the most frequent 200 explicit LATs

37
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,550
cover less than 50% of the questions.

38
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,420
So to enhance the question analysis step,

39
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,360
Watson also performs relation detection

40
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,020
to find relationships among words and decomposition

41
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,980
to split the question into different clues.

42
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,220


43
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,280
The second step in Watson is hypothesis generation.

44
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,100
The goal of this step is to use the question analysis of step

45
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,190
one to produce candidate answers by searching the databases.

46
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,510
In this step several hundred candidate answers

47
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,280
are generated.

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,700
For the question, "Mozart's last and perhaps most powerful

49
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,520
symphony shares its name with this planet,"

50
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,050
candidate answers could be Mercury, Earth, and Jupiter.

51
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,760
These are generated using various search techniques.

52
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,430


53
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,380
Then each candidate answer plugged back

54
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,750
into the question in place of the LAT

55
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,700
is considered a hypothesis.

56
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,100
For the question about Mozart's symphony,

57
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,200
hypothesis one would be the question

58
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,400
with "Mercury" in place of "this planet."

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,490
Hypothesis two would have "Jupiter"

60
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,360
in place of "this planet."

61
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,510
And hypothesis three would have "Earth"

62
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,050
in place of "this planet."

63
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,350
If the correct answer is not generated at this stage,

64
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,260
Watson has no hope of getting the question right.

65
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,760
Therefore, this step errors on the side

66
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,220
of generating a lot of hypotheses

67
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,040
and leaves it up to the next step

68
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,260
to find the correct answer.

69
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,140
In the next video, we'll discuss how steps three and four

70
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,931
score and rank the hypotheses.

71
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:37,430
