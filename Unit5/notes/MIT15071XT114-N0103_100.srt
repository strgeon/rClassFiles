1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,650
In this lecture, we'll be trying to understand sentiment

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,280
of tweets about the company Apple.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,530
Apple is a computer company known for its laptops, phones,

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,280
tablets, and personal media players.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,250
While Apple has a large number of fans,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,220
they also have a large number of people

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,950
who don't like their products.

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:23,540
And they have several competitors.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,390
To better understand public perception,

10
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,530
Apple wants to monitor how people feel over time

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,600
and how people receive new announcements.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,080
Our challenge in this lecture is to see if we can correctly

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,400
classify tweets as being negative, positive, or neither

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,510
about Apple.

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,140
To collect the data needed for this task,

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,820
we had to perform two steps.

17
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,750
The first was to collect data about tweets from the internet.

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,060
Twitter data is publicly available.

19
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,690
And you can collect it through scraping the website

20
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,680
or by using a special interface for programmers

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,000
that Twitter provides called an API.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,210
The sender of the tweet might be useful to predict sentiment.

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,020
But we'll ignore it to keep our data anonymized.

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,196
So we'll just be using the text of the tweet.

25
00:01:15,196 --> 00:01:18,260
Then we need to construct the outcome variable

26
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,330
for these tweets, which means that we have to label them

27
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,170
as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

28
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,960
We would like to label thousands of tweets.

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,540
And we know that two people might disagree over

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,380
the correct classification of a tweet.

31
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,100
So to do this efficiently, one option

32
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,890
is to use the Amazon Mechanical Turk.

33
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,630


34
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,870
So what is the Amazon Mechanical Turk?

35
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:49,160
It allows people to break tasks down into small components

36
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,670
and then enables them to distribute these tasks online

37
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,250
to be solved by people all over the world.

38
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,520
People can sign up to perform the available tasks for a fee.

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,220
As the task creator, we pay the workers

40
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,760
a fixed amount per completed task.

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,472
For example, we might pay $0.02 for a single classified tweet.

42
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:13,610
The Amazon Mechanical Turk serves as a broker

43
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,520
and takes a small cut of the money.

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,140
Many of the tasks on the Mechanical Turk

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,830
require human intelligence, like classifying

46
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,620
the sentiment of a tweet.

47
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,890
But these tasks may be time consuming

48
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,120
or require building otherwise unneeded capacity

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,900
for the creator of the task.

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,570
And so it's appealing to outsource the job.

51
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,840
The task that we put on the Amazon Mechanical Turk

52
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,590
was to judge the sentiment expressed

53
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:45,760
by the following item toward the software company Apple.

54
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,300
The items we gave them were tweets that we had collected.

55
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,550
The workers could pick from the following options

56
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:56,410
as their response-- strongly negative, negative, neutral,

57
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,220
positive, and strongly positive.

58
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,340
We represented each of these outcomes

59
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,806
as a number on the scale from negative 2 to 2.

60
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:08,540
We had five workers label each tweet.

61
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,930
The graph on the right shows the distribution

62
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,710
of the number of tweets classified

63
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:14,900
into each of the categories.

64
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,760
We can see here that the majority of tweets

65
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,430
were classified as neutral, with a small number classified

66
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,495
as strongly negative or strongly positive.

67
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,750


68
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,670
Then, for each tweet, we take the average of the five scores

69
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,690
given by the five workers.

70
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,620
For example, the tweet "LOVE U @APPLE"

71
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,010
was seen as strongly positive by 4 of the workers

72
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,260
and positive by one of the workers.

73
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,460
So it gets a score of 1.8.

74
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,150
The tweet "@apple @twitter Happy Programmers' Day folks!"

75
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,510
was seen as slightly positive on average.

76
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,480
And the tweet "So disappointed in @Apple.

77
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,210
Sold me a Macbook Air that WONT run my apps.

78
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,170
So I have to drive hours to return it.

79
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,300
They won't let me ship it." was seen as pretty negative.

80
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,050
So now we have a bunch of tweets that

81
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,710
are labeled with their sentiment.

82
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,260
But how do we build independent variables

83
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,760
from the text of a tweet to be used to predict the sentiment?

84
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,810
In the next video, we'll discuss a technique

85
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,829
called bag of words that transforms text

86
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,370
into independent variables.

87
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:21,942
