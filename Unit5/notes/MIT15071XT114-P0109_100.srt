1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,650
This week we'll see how we can use analytics

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,860
to understand opinions and intelligence.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,800
In the first lecture, we'll see how

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,660
we can use Tweets on Twitter to understand sentiment and public

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,040
perception.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,240
In the second lecture, we'll discuss

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,030
how IBM built a computer that could beat the best

8
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,470
human players at Jeopardy, a popular game show.

9
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,760
Through these examples, we'll introduce the exciting area

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,990
of text analytics, and see how we can turn words

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,800
into variables to be used in our models.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,780
Let's get started.

13
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,366
