1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,810
Let's conclude with a word about the status of predictive coding

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,600
today.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,250
In legal systems, it's difficult to change existing practice

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,450
because of laws reliance on past precedent, which

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,850
causes current decisions to be made on the basis of past ones.

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,920
Because the types of eDiscovery admissible in court

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,070
have historically been limited to keyword search coupled

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,810
with manual review, nearly all cases

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,950
today use this eDiscovery approach.

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,610
However, this status quo seems to be starting to change.

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,540
In 2012, a US District Court ruled that predictive coding

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,060
was a legitimate eDiscovery tool, which

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,756
may pave the way for its expanded use in coming years.

14
00:00:43,756 --> 00:00:44,256
