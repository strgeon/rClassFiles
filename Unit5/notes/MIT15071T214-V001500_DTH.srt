00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,490
So why is the game of Jeopardy hard for a computer?

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,090
We said earlier that Watson had 3,000 processors and a database

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,700
of 200 million pages of information.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,620
So shouldn't it be easy for Watson to play Jeopardy?

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,440
Unfortunately, Jeopardy has a wide variety

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,100
of categories which are purposely made cryptic.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,960
While computers can easily answer precise questions,

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,290
like computing the square root of a complicated number,

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,470
understanding natural language is hard for computers.

10
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,570
As an example, suppose we ask Watson to answer the question:

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,620
Where was Albert Einstein born?

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,770
Stored in its database, Watson might

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,610
have the following information: "One day, from his city

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,420
views of Ulm, Otto chose a watercolor

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,140
to send to Albert Einstein as a remembrance of his birthplace."

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,460
As a human, we can probably figure out

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,530
that the name of the city is Ulm,

18
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,360
but this is a hard sentence to parse.

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,030
How would you tell a computer that Albert Einstein was

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,205
born in Ulm using just this sentence?

21
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:10,820


22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,320
OK.

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,490
So how about if we just store answers

24
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,330
to all possible questions that could be asked on Jeopardy?

25
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,145
Unfortunately, this would be impossible.

26
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:24,600
An analysis of 200,000 previous Jeopardy questions

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,070
yielded over 2,500 different categories,

28
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,270
and new questions are created on Jeopardy all the time.

29
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,570
Well, OK, then let's just search Google

30
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,890
for the answer to the question.

31
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,800
Unfortunately, no links to the outside world

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,240
are permitted on Jeopardy, and this rule

33
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,610
applied to Watson as well.

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,700
And even if Watson could search the internet for the answer

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,940
to a question, it can take considerable skill

36
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,950
to find the right web page with the right information.

37
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,380
So instead, Watson used analytics

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,780
to answer the Jeopardy questions.

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,180
Watson received each question in text form.

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,250
Normally, the players see and hear the questions,

41
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,860
but Watson couldn't hear anything,

42
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,260
so they decided to feed him the questions in text instead.

43
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,990
With the question in text form, IBM

44
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,660
was able to use text analytics and other analytical methods

45
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,600
to make Watson a competitive player.

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,200
Overall, they used 100 different techniques

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,760
for analyzing natural language, finding hypotheses

48
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,860
for the questions, and ranking these hypotheses

49
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,830
to pick an answer.

50
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,910
Watson had a huge database of sources and several basic tools

51
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,310
to help understand language.

52
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,270
The database consisted of a massive number of data sources,

53
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,970
like encyclopedias, texts, manuals, magazines,

54
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,700
and downloaded pages of Wikipedia.

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,220
One of the tools Watson had was a lexicon,

56
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,880
which describes the relationship between different words.

57
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,250
For example, the lexicon could tell Watson

58
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,560
that water is a clear liquid, but not all clear liquids

59
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,220
are water.

60
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,500
Another tool Watson had was a part

61
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,490
of speech tagger and parser.

62
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,400
This would identify functions of words in text.

63
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,190
For example, it would know that the word "race"

64
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,330
can be used as a verb or a noun.

65
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:26,030
"The students had to race to catch the bus"

66
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,210
uses race as a verb, while "Please indicate your race"

67
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,400
uses race as a noun.

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Then, using these data sources and tools,

69
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Watson would answer a question by going

70
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,930
through four major steps.

71
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,730
The first step is question analysis,

72
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,640
where Watson tries to figure out what

73
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,990
the question is looking for.

74
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,350
The second step is hypothesis generation,

75
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,380
where Watson searches the information

76
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,410
sources for possible answers.

77
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,740
After this, Watson moves on to step

78
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,330
three, when the different hypotheses are scored.

79
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,100
This means that a confidence level

80
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,570
has to be computed for each answer.

81
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,490
The final step is ranking the hypotheses

82
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,890
to look for a highly-supported answer.

83
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,320
In the next two videos, we'll go through how each of these steps

84
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,870
work.
