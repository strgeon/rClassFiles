0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840


1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,900
The graph shows on the horizontal axis the percentage

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:10,290
of questions answered, and on the vertical axis,

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:16,030
the percentage of answers that were correct.

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:24,620
When Watson started, the graph that shows its performance

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,990
is shown here.

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:34,910
In 2007, we observed that the performance of Watson improved,

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,180
and it is shown there.

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:46,670
And then successively from 2008 May to 2010,

9
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,100
we see the successive improvement of Watson

10
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,870
in this graph that shows a trade-off between questions

11
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:57,050
answered and precision.

12
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,090
This is the area of the best human players.

13
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,459
Observe that they answer a high number of questions

14
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,500
and they answer a very high number of questions correctly.

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,670
So it was at that time-- 2010-- that the people that

16
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,350
controlled the decision decided that Watson

17
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,115
is ready to enter the competition.

18
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:21,170


19
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:24,950
So the games were scheduled for February 2011.

20
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,340
Two games were played, and the winner

21
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:31,201
would be the contestant with the highest winnings over the two

22
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:31,700
games.

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,570


24
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,760
Once we got into the game, it was nerve-wracking, frankly.

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,400
Brad, if you're ready, make your first choice.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,960
Let's take "Alternate Meanings" for $200, Alex.

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,891
"4-letter word for a vantage point or a belief."

28
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:48,390
Brad.

29
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,061
What is a view?

30
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:49,560
Yes.

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,520
After the first clue of the game, which Brad won,

32
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,240
I had just this horrible feeling at that moment

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,660
that he was as good as everyone said he was,

34
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,200
and he was just going to run the whole board on us.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,160
"Alternate Meanings," $400.

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,170
"4-letter word for the iron fitting on the hoof of a horse

37
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,371
or a card-dealing box in a casino."

38
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:10,870
Watson.

39
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,767
What is shoe?

40
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:12,350
You are right.

41
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,433
We actually took the lead.

42
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,430
We were ahead of them.

43
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,471
But then we started getting some questions wrong.

44
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,010
Watson.

45
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,900
What is leg?

46
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,450
No, I'm sorry, I can't accept that.

47
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,980
What is 1920s?

48
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,550
No.

49
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,800
What is chic?

50
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,680
No, sorry.

51
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,280
Brad?

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,900
What is class?

53
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,260
Class, you got it.

54
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,030
Watson.

55
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,090
What is Sauron?

56
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,580
Sauron is right, and that puts you

57
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,966
into a tie for the lead with Brad.

58
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:36,340
A lot of people were feeling good

59
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,420
because Watson held his own and was doing pretty well.

60
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,780
But I wanted to be winning.

61
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,910
Too close for comfort.

62
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,040
Ken, you're in third place.

63
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,500
That means you go first in "Double Jeopardy."

64
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,990
The "Double Jeopardy" round of the first game I thought

65
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,830
was phenomenal.

66
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,010
Watson went on a terror.

67
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,900
Watson.

68
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,220
Who is Franz Liszt?

69
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,950
You are right.

70
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,070
What is violin?

71
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,600
Good.

72
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,496
Who is The Church Lady?

73
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:03,330
Yes.

74
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,290
Watson.

75
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,610
What is narcolepsy?

76
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,200
You are right.

77
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,600
And with that, you move to $36,681.

78
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,330
After the first game, we have a pretty good commanding lead,

79
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,146
but we've seen enough Jeopardy to know

80
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,270
that this is not a lockout.

81
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,660


82
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,510
Welcome to the deciding game in the IBM Challenge here

83
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,370
on Jeopardy!.

84
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,920
The second game was a whole other story.

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,290
We struggled some at the beginning.

86
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,040
"Actors Who Direct" for $1,000.

87
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,870
"A Bronx Tale."

88
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,390
Brad.

89
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,880
Who is Robert De Niro?

90
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,460
Correct.

91
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,010
That was an awful category because Watson

92
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,380
got every single one right, but was just a little too slow.

93
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,000
Ken.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,740
Who is Denzel Washington?

95
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,239
You got him.

96
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:51,790
Ken and Brad were getting the answer in a second.

97
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,581
"Rocky II", "III", & "IV."

98
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:54,080
Brad.

99
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,230
Who is Sylvester Stallone?

100
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:55,970
Correct.

101
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,310
Even with 2,800 cores, it took us 2 1/2 seconds or 3 seconds,

102
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,060
and that just gives you a sense of how incredible the human

103
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,610
brain is-- how quickly it could understand the category,

104
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,570
what's being asked.

105
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:06,670
Boom!

106
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,461
And get the answer.

107
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:08,240
Who is Sean Penn?

108
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,860
Right.

109
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,870
Ken was doing very well.

110
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,260
And the risk was if Ken gets a "Daily Double," that's big.

111
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,087
Gets it right, he's going to be well ahead.

112
00:04:17,087 --> 00:04:19,670
And then with that kind of lead going into "Final Jeaoprady"--

113
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,300
if he bets enough, he could end up winning the match.

114
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,450
"A camel is a horse designed by this."

115
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:25,950
Ken.

116
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,760
What's a committee?

117
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,260
Good.

118
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,650
"Familiar Sayings" for $2,000.

119
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,400
We've gotta find that last "Daily Double."

120
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,390
We've gotta find that last "Daily Double."

121
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,740
It was nail-biting.

122
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,340
I mean, it was just intense.

123
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,440
Because these guys were good.

124
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:37,940
Ken.

125
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,710
Who is the brain?

126
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,570
Brain, yes.

127
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,555
There was a crucial moment in the game.

128
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:41,930
There was still a "Daily Double" on the board

129
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,450
and it was starting to become pretty clear that it

130
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,385
was in the "Legal E's" category.

131
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:49,100
Let's go to "Legal E's" for $1,200.

132
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,980
"This person is appointed by a testator

133
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,840
to carry out the directions and requests in his will."

134
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,400
Watson.

135
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,670
What is executor?

136
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,600
Right.

137
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,710
Same category, $1,600.

138
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,210
Answer-- "Daily Double."

139
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,740
That was the moment when I knew it's over.

140
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,400
Let us look at the results of the game.

141
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,630
Looking at these numbers, it is fair to say

142
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,100
that Watson's victory over the two best human players

143
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,840
has been a decisive one.

144
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,340
In the first day, Watson's winnings

145
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:31,790
were more than double the sum of the winnings of both players.

146
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:38,050
And in the second day, it was more than their sum.

147
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:44,150
Overall, the winnings for Watson were almost double

148
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,090
the sum of the winnings of both players--

149
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,800
a rather decisive victory.

150
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,520


151
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,050
So what's next for Watson?

152
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,010
So Watson is ideally suited to answer questions which

153
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,960
cover a wide range of material and often

154
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,250
have to deal with inconsistent or incomplete information.

155
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,390
This makes it particularly appropriate for applications

156
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,920
like medicine.

157
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,050
Note that the amount of medical information available

158
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,800
is doubling every five years, and a lot of the data

159
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,310
is unstructured.

160
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:26,380
As a result, Watson has been utilized for cancer diagnosis

161
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,150
and selecting the best course of treatment.

162
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,130
And Watson has been in discussions

163
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:37,710
with MD Anderson and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centers

164
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,310
to apply the Watson technology for cancer diagnosis

165
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,785
and selecting the best course of treatment.

166
00:06:44,785 --> 00:06:48,920


167
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,370
So what is the analytics edge of Watson?

168
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,530
First, we have observed that the major technology of Watson

169
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,690
is to combine many algorithms that

170
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,470
increase the accuracy and the confidence

171
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,090
of the overall outcome.

172
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,410
Any one of these algorithms would not have worked,

173
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,940
but their combination gives Watson a considerable edge.

174
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,926
The second important observation that gives Watson an edge

175
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:17,300
is that it approaches the problem in a very different way

176
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,390
than how a human approaches a problem.

177
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:24,140
A key aspect of the technology is hypothesis generation,

178
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,980
and then using different and distinct algorithms

179
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,170
to explore this hypothesis and combining them,

180
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,320
it leads to answers that provide an edge.

181
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,580
Finally, and quite importantly, Watson

182
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,440
has a considerable ability to deal

183
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,670
with massive amounts of data, often in unstructured form.

184
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,440
And the vast majority of the data-- 90% of it-- is, in fact,

185
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,410
unstructured.

186
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,300
So the combination of these ideas

187
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,830
give Watson a significant edge.

188
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:59,790
It is no accident that IBM has invested so far more than $24

189
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,680
billion to invest in Watson technologies,

190
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,190
and it has created a company within IBM

191
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,080
called Watson Solutions, whose key objective is

192
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,580
to apply the Watson technology and the edge

193
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,570
that it creates to a variety of verticals, one of which

194
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,280
is medicine.
