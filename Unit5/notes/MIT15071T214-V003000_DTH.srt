00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,340
The game of Jeopardy has three rounds.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,380
Jeopardy, Double Jeopardy, where the dollar values are doubled,

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,790
and Final Jeopardy, when contestants

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:17,070
can wager an amount of money on one single question.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,800
Each round has five questions in six categories.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,170
It consists of a wide variety of topics,

7
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:26,710
over 2,500 different categories.

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,630
Each question has dollar value.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,955
The first to buzz in and answer correctly wins the money.

10
00:00:31,955 --> 00:00:35,380
If they answer incorrectly, they lose the money.

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,380
An example of a round involves the following categories:

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,830
Dinosaurs, Notable Women, Oxford English Dictionary,

13
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,770
Name That Instrument, Belgium, and Composers by Country.

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,970
The type of questions Jeopardy includes,

15
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,460
includes cryptic definitions of categories and clues.

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,680
And the answer is in the form of a question.

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,500
Let me give you two examples.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,930
Question is: Mozart's last and perhaps most powerful symphony

19
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,840
shares its name with this planet.

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,740
The answer should be, "What is Jupiter?"

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,550
Another example: smaller than only Greenland,

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,620
it's the world's second largest island.

23
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,400
And the answer, "What is New Guinea?"

24
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,320
Welcome back.

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,080
Ken, you've got your signalling device ready I see.

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,170
Here are the categories for you to select

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,170
from in Double Jeopardy.

28
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,140
First off, Etude, Brute.

29
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,550
Next, Hedgehog-Podge.

30
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,290
Don't Worry About It.

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,630
The Art of the Steal.

32
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,320
Cambridge.

33
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,440
And finally, "Church" & "State" with each of those words

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,410
in quotation marks.

35
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,215
Start us off.

36
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:50,590
Let's try "Don't Worry About It",

37
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,750
all the down at $2,000, Alex.

38
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,200
It's just acne!

39
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,900
You don't have this skin infection also known

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,900
as Hansen's disease.

41
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,700
Watson.

42
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,150

43
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,110
You are right.

44
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,610
"Etude, Brute" for $1,600.

45
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,220
Music fans wax rhapsodic about this Hungarian's

46
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,720
"transcendental etudes."

47
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,560
Watson.

48
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,900
Who is Franz Liszt?

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,800
You are right.

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,020
"Don't Worry About It" for $1,600.

51
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,420
You're just a little stiff!

52
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,640
You don't have this painful mosquito-borne joint illness

53
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,460
with a Swahili name.

54
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,340
Watson.

55
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,730

56
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,950
Dengue Fever, correct.

57
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,590
"Etude, Brute" for $1,200.

58
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,400
Paganini's "24 Capricci" set the standard for etudes

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,240
for this instrument.

60
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:36,950
Watson.

61
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,990
What is violin?

62
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,540
Good.
