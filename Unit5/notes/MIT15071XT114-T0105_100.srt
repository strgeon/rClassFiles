00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,530


1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,420
After Watson has completed the initial two steps of question

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,350
analysis and hypothesis generation,

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,840
it's then time to move on to step three,

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,040
where each of the hypotheses are scored.

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,920
In this step, Watson computes confidence levels

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,320
for each possible answer or hypothesis.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,810
This is necessary to accurately estimate

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,530
the probability of a proposed answer being correct.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,610
Watson will only buzz in to answer a question

10
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,240
if a confidence level for one of the hypotheses

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,250
is above a threshold.

12
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,610
To compute these confidence levels,

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,980
Watson combines a large number of different methods.

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,510
First, Watson starts with lightweight scoring algorithms

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,660
to prune down the large set of hypotheses.

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,630
Recall that in step two, about 200 different hypotheses

17
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,420
were generated.

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,200
An example of a lightweight scoring algorithm

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,640
is computing the likelihood that a candidate answer is actually

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,030
an instance of the LAT.

21
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,570
For the Mozart symphony question where the LAT is "this planet,"

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,140
a candidate answer like "Earth" would have a very high score,

23
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,600
but a candidate answer like, "the moon"

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,960
would have a lower score.

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,460
If the likelihood is not very high,

26
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,470
Watson throws away the hypothesis.

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,490
The candidate answers that pass this step proceed

28
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,550
to the next stage of the scoring algorithms.

29
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,750
Watson lets about 100 candidate answers

30
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,260
pass on to the next stage.

31
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,970


32
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,150
Then Watson moves into more advanced scoring analytics.

33
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,810
Watson needs to gather supporting evidence

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,090
for each candidate answer.

35
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,320
One way of doing this is through a method

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,770
called passage search, where passages

37
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,130
are retrieved that contain the hypothesis text.

38
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,610
To simulate this, let's see what happens

39
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,160
when we search for two of our hypotheses on Google.

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,850
Our first hypothesis is "Mozart's last

41
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,200
and perhaps most powerful symphony shares

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,010
its name with Mercury."

43
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,860
And our second hypothesis is "Mozart's last

44
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,310
and perhaps most powerful symphony shares

45
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,550
its name with Jupiter."

46
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,870
On Google, if we search for Mozart, symphony, and Mercury,

47
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,270
we get about 900,000 results.

48
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,350
And we get some good results.

49
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,330
They definitely mention the three words we searched for,

50
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,440
but Mercury is only next to symphony once.

51
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,700
And there's no mention about this being his last symphony.

52
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,570
Now, if we search for Mozart, symphony, and Jupiter,

53
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,290
we get about 1.5 million results,

54
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,630
and they look much more promising.

55
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,390
We see the phrase "last symphony" a couple times

56
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:47,510
and "Jupiter symphony" more than once.

57
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,250
Therefore, the hypothesis with Jupiter

58
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,120
seems to be more supported than the hypothesis with Mercury.

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,790


60
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,690
Now, the scoring analytics determine the degree

61
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,740
of certainty that the evidence supports the candidate answers.

62
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,170
More than 50 different scoring components are used.

63
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,410
One example is analyzing temporal relationships.

64
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,340
Consider the Jeopardy question-- "In 1594, he

65
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,100
took a job as a tax collector in Andalusia."

66
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,380
Two candidate answers are Thoreau and Cervantes.

67
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,870
However, this algorithm would determine

68
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,360
that Thoreau was not born until 1817.

69
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,790
So it would give a higher score to Cervantes.

70
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,800
Once all of the scoring algorithms are run,

71
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,710
Watson needs to select the single best supported

72
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,360
hypothesis.

73
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,990
Before this can be done, similar answers

74
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:46,415
need to be merged, since multiple candidate answers may

75
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:48,170
be equivalent.

76
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,690
As an example, the candidate answers

77
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:55,800
"Abraham Lincoln" and "Honest Abe" refer to the same person.

78
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,240
So the scores for these two candidate answers

79
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,980
need to be combined.

80
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,410
Watson should not be viewing similar answers

81
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,820
as competing choices.

82
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,830
Now, Watson is ready to rank the hypotheses

83
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,130
and estimate an overall confidence for each.

84
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,740
To do this, predictive analytics are used.

85
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,779
To compute an overall confidence level for each candidate

86
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,470
answer, Watson uses logistic regression.

87
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,410
The training data is a set of historical Jeopardy questions

88
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,960
and all of the candidate answers.

89
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,700
Each of the scoring algorithms is

90
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,770
used as an independent variable.

91
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,110
Then, logistic regression is used to predict whether or not

92
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,390
a candidate answer is correct using the scores.

93
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,800
This gives each score a weight and computes

94
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,620
an overall profitability or confidence

95
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,380
that a candidate answer is correct.

96
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,330
If the highest confidence level for one of the candidate

97
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,140
answers for a question is high enough,

98
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,240
Watson buzzes in to answer the question.

99
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,780


100
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,520
In total, the Watson system is composed

101
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,090
of eight refrigerator-sized cabinets

102
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,020
and has high-speed local storage for all information.

103
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,280
It originally took over two hours to answer one question.

104
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,280
And the team had to reduce this to two to six seconds.

105
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,890
In the next video, we'll see how Watson progressed in the six

106
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,890
years between starting and playing on Jeopardy,

107
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,240
what happened during the game, and what

108
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,129
the Watson team is working on now.

109
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:29,629
