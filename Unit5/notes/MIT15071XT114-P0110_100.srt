Hi.

2
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,090
I'm John, and I'll be leading the recitation this week.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,580
We'll be looking into how to use the text of emails

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,980
in the inboxes of Enron executives

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,310
to predict if those emails are relevant to an investigation

6
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,440
into the company.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,320
We'll be extracting word frequencies

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,260
from the text of the documents, and then

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,620
integrating those frequencies into predictive models.

10
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,510
Let's get started.
