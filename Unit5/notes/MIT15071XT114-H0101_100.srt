1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,280
In this recitation, we're going to talk

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,175
about predictive coding-- an emerging

3
00:00:04,175 --> 00:00:08,820
use of text analytics in the area of criminal justice.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,930
We'll start with the story of Enron, the United States energy

5
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:14,650
company based out of Houston, Texas that was involved

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,370
in a number of electricity production and distribution

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,540
markets.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,560
In the early 2000s, Enron was a hot company,

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,860
with a market capitalization exceeding $60 billion,

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,340
and Forbes magazine ranked it as the most innovative US

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,700
company six years in a row.

12
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,850
Now, all that changed in 2001 with the news

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,820
of widespread accounting fraud at the firm.

14
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,950
This massive fraud led to Enron's bankruptcy, the largest

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,280
ever at the time, and led to Enron's accounting firm, Arthur

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,840
Andersen, dissolving.

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,470
To this day, Enron remains a symbol

18
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,750
of corporate greed and corruption.

19
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,150
Now, while Enron's collapse stemmed largely

20
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,260
from accounting fraud, the firm also

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,820
faced sanctions for its involvement

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,110
in the California electricity crisis.

23
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:03,160
California is the most populous state in the United States.

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,900
And in 2000 to 2001, it had a number of power blackouts,

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,220
despite having sufficient generating capacity.

26
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,970
It later surfaced that Enron played a key role

27
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,050
in this energy crisis by artificially reducing

28
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,880
power supply to spike prices and then

29
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,840
making a profit from this market instability.

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,160
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC,

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,000
investigated Enron's involvement in the crisis,

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,920
and this investigation eventually

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,980
led to a $1.52 billion settlement.

34
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,440
FERC's investigation into Enron will

35
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,200
be the topic of today's recitation.

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,570
Now, Enron was a huge company, and its corporate servers

37
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,190
contained millions of emails and other electronic files.

38
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,000
Sifting through these documents to find

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,860
the ones relevant to an investigation

40
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,780
is no simple task.

41
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,090
In law, this electronic document retrieval process

42
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,350
is called the eDiscovery problem,

43
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,390
and relevant files are called responsive documents.

44
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,190
Traditionally, the eDiscovery problem has been solved

45
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,910
by using keyword search-- in our case, perhaps,

46
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,250
searching for phrases like "electricity bid"

47
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,110
or "energy schedule"-- followed by an expensive

48
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,820
and time-consuming manual review process,

49
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,260
in which attorneys read through thousands of documents

50
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,030
to determine which ones are responsive.

51
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,780
However, predictive coding is a new technique,

52
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,450
in which attorneys manually label some documents

53
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,010
and then use text analytics models trained

54
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,950
on the manually labeled documents

55
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,150
to predict which of the remaining documents

56
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,480
are responsive.

57
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,570
Now, as part of its investigation,

58
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,910
the FERC released hundreds of thousands of emails

59
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,370
from top executives at Enron creating the largest publicly

60
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,480
available set of emails today.

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,410
We will use this data set called the Enron Corpus to perform

62
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,330
predictive coding in this recitation.

63
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,980
Our data set contains just two fields--

64
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,030
email, which is the text of the email in question,

65
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,760
and responsive, which is whether the email relates

66
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,110
to energy schedules or bids.

67
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,780
The labels for these emails were made

68
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,530
by attorneys as part of the 2010 text retrieval conference

69
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,057
legal track, a predictive coding competition.

70
00:03:16,057 --> 00:03:16,556
