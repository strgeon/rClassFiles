1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,210
This is a lecture of how IBM built a computer that plays

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,100
the very popular game of Jeopardy!.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,160
In 2004, IBM Vice President Charles Lickel and coworkers

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,890
were having dinner at a restaurant.

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,160
All of a sudden, the restaurant fell silent.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,770
Everyone was watching the game Jeopardy!

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,210
on the television.

8
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,040
A contestant, Ken Jennings, was setting the record

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,690
for the longest winning streak of all time, 75 days.

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,920
Why was everyone so interested?

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,420
Jeopardy!

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,080
is a quiz show that asks complex and clever questions like puns,

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,940
obscure facts, and uncommon words.

14
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,380
It originally aired in 1964.

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,330
It covers a huge variety of topics,

16
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,630
and it's generally viewed as an impressive feat

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,600
to do well in this game.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,040
No computer system has ever been developed that could even come

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,630
close to competing with humans on Jeopardy!.

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:58,030


21
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,370
IBM Research strives to push the limits of science.

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,560
It has a tradition of addressing inspiring and difficult

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,640
challenges over the years.

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,300
In the mid '90s, it built Deep Blue, a computer,

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,060
to compete against the best human chess players,

26
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,530
and then in the mid '90s, Deep Blue

27
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,530
beat Garry Kasparov, who was at that time

28
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,260
the world champion in chess.

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,650
Later it built Blue Gene, a computer

30
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,740
to map the human genome.

31
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,600


32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,310
In 2005, a team at IBM Research started

33
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,680
creating a computer that would compete at Jeopardy!

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,870
Of course, no one knew at the time how to beat humans

35
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,610
or if it was even possible.

36
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,610
Six years later, a two-game exhibition match

37
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,040
aired on television.

38
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,395
The winner would receive a million dollars.

39
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:54,900


40
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,030
The contestants were Ken Jennings, the longest winning

41
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,550
champion, whose longest winning streak was 75 days;

42
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,940
Brad Rutter, who was the biggest money winner of over 3.5

43
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,850
million; and Watson, a supercomputer with 3,000

44
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,000
processors and a database of 200 million pages of information.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,779


46
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:22,723
This is Jeopardy!-- The IBM Challenge.

47
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:24,695


48
00:02:24,695 --> 00:02:30,118
And now, here is the host of Jeopardy!, Alex Trebek.

49
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:32,486


50
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:33,569
Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.

51
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,541
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

52
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:39,280
And welcome, everyone, to a very special Jeopardy! event.

53
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,010
For the next three days, we're going

54
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,430
to be coming to you from this IBM Research facility just

55
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,490
outside of New York City.

56
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,210
And let me tell you why.

57
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,590
A little over three years ago, the folks at IBM

58
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,320
came to us with a proposal that they considered

59
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,550
to be the next grand challenge in computing.

60
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,280
And that was designing a computer system

61
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,120
that could understand the complexities

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,700
of natural language well enough to compete

63
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,240
against Jeopardy!'s best players.

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,760
Well, they think they've succeeded,

65
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,270
and that's why we're here today.

66
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,340
So you are about to witness what may prove to be an historic

67
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,200
competition -- an exhibition match pitting an IBM computer

68
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,710
system against the two most celebrated and successful

69
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,050
players in Jeopardy! history.

70
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,620
Sounds like a lot of fun, doesn't it?

71
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,570
Developed and programmed especially for this moment,

72
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,840
making its first appearance on our national television

73
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,740
program, ladies and gentlemen, this is Watson.

74
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:40,211


75
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:43,510
Just as I expected, that was a very warm reception.

76
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,470
And I'm sure Watson would've appreciated

77
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,910
the applause, except for one thing.

78
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,340
Watson can neither hear nor see.

79
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,360
It will be receiving all of its information electronically.

80
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,120
And as a matter of fact, what you're looking at right now

81
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,670
is not the real Watson.

82
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,790
This is an avatar.

83
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,400
This is a representation of Watson.

84
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,770
Watson, of course, is a sophisticated computer system

85
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,740
too big and too heavy to fit behind that lectern

86
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,520
on our stage.

87
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,070
But it is close by.

88
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,510
It's right next door.

89
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,269
And a little while ago, I paid it a visit.

90
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,920
The very first thing you will notice

91
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,470
as I come into Watson's space is noise.

92
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,600
There is a lot of noise.

93
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,370
A little bit comes from Watson himself, but most of the noise

94
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,030
comes from two very large refrigerator

95
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,980
units that help to keep Watson cool.

96
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,310
Now as you can see, Watson has been set up in two units.

97
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,220
Each half contains five separate racks.

98
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:56,190
Each of these racks contains 10 IBM Power 750 servers.

99
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,840
Now when you link all of these servers

100
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,770
together, as they have done for Watson,

101
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,090
you create a deep analytic system

102
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,100
that is the equivalent of 2,800 powerful computers tied

103
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,860
together in a super high speed network.
