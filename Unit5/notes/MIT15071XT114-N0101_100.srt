1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,900
This is our first lecture on text analytics.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,870
We'll discuss how can use data from Twitter

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,320
and turn them into knowledge.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,101


5
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:13,100
Twitter is a social networking and communication

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,890
website founded in 2006.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,000
Users share and send messages that

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,130
can be no longer than 140 characters long.

9
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,350
It is indeed one of the Top 10 most visited sites

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:25,190
on the internet.

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,210
It had an initial public offering in 2013,

12
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,650
and it's current valuation is about $31 billion.

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,290
Let's discuss the impact of Twitter.

14
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,850
Protesters around the world use Twitter.

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,380
It had an important impact on Arab Spring.

16
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,420
People also use it as a method of notification

17
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,360
for natural disasters and for tracking diseases.

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,750
Celebrities, politicians, and companies

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,290
connect with fans and customers using Twitter.

20
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,020
Everyone is watching.

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,270
To illustrate this last point, let

22
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,530
us discuss a tweet that was supposed

23
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,060
to be from the Associated Press.

24
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,910
The Associated Press is a major news agency

25
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,290
that distributes news stories to other news agencies.

26
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:17,830
In April 2013, someone tweeted this message

27
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,450
from the main AP verified Twitter account.

28
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,370
It said that two explosions in the White House and Barack

29
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,855
Obama is injured.

30
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:32,000
The S&P 500 stock index fell 1% in seconds,

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,315
but the White House rapidly clarified.

32
00:01:34,315 --> 00:01:37,010


33
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,460
Many companies maintain online presences.

34
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,255
Managing public perception in an age of instant communication

35
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:44,980
is essential.

36
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,560
Reacting to changing sentiment, identifying offensive posts,

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,300
determining topics of interest are indeed crucial.

38
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,060
In this lecture, we'll see how we

39
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,433
can use analytics to address these questions.

40
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:57,933
