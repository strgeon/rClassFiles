00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,310
Let us next examine the impact that the Framingham Heart

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,480
Study had through the years.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,870


4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,930
So the graph on the right shows the number

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:18,510
of papers written every year using data

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,650
from the Framingham Study as a function of time,

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,790
and we observe the very significant increase

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,750
in the number of such publications.

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,360
Altogether, there has been 2,400 studies

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,950
written using the Framingham data.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,430
During the years, many other risk factors were evaluated.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,650
Obesity, exercise, psychological,

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,880
and social issues.

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,210
In fact, the Texas Heart Institute Journal

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,620
named the Framingham Heart Study as the top 10 cardiology

16
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,090
advance of the 20th century.

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,432


18
00:00:58,432 --> 00:00:59,890
In addition to the study, there has

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,129
been an online tool that assesses

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:12,830
the risk for your 10-year risk of having a heart attack.

21
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:20,470
So you input in this online tool your age, your gender,

22
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,390
the total cholesterol, the HDL cholesterol,

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,140
whether or not you are a smoker, the systolic blood pressure,

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:36,800
and then it calculates your 10-year risk.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,120
So how about new research directions and challenges

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,860
that the study is facing?

27
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,440


28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,550
So currently, we are in the third generation that

29
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,690
started in 2002, but there was also a second generation

30
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,700
study of people enrolled in 1971,

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,880
and the third started in 2002.

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,580
As a result, this enables the study

33
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,440
to examine family history as a risk factor.

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,230
More diverse cohorts started in 1994 and 2003.

35
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:18,910
In addition to the classical measures we have used so far,

36
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,080
social network analysis of the participants

37
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,130
has also been utilized.

38
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,900
And additionally and quite importantly,

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,290
genome -wide association study is underway linking genetics

40
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,010
to heart conditions as a risk factor.

41
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,800
Of course, many challenges are related to funding.

42
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,110
Funding cuts in 1969 nearly closed the study,

43
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,630
and the 2013 sequester is threatening

44
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,960
to close the study as well.

45
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,460


46
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,850
A very important impact of the Framingham Heart Study

47
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,130
is the development of clinical decision rules.

48
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,980
The early work on the study paved the way

49
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,530
for clinical decision rules as it is done today.

50
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:14,320
And the graph shows the clinical prediction rules

51
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:22,980
published as a function of the year from 1960s to today.

52
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,000
And you observe that more than 70,000 published rules,

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,990
clinical decision rules, have been published across medicine,

54
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:38,410
and you observe that the rate of publication is increasing.

55
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,620
So these clinical decision rules are

56
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,590
developed using patient and disease characteristics,

57
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,550
and then observed test results from patients

58
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,372
that can assess the effectiveness of such rules.

59
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:52,872
