1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,270
In this lecture, we'll describe the Framingham Heart Study, one

2
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,189
of the most important epidemiological studies ever

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,110
conducted, and the underlying analytics that

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,170
led to our current understanding of cardiovascular disease.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,850


6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,060
To motivate how the study affected our understanding

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,870
of blood pressure today, we describe the case

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:26,060
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, FDR

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,680
for short, who was the President of the United States

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,350
from 1933 to 1945.

11
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,300
He was the longest-serving president of the United States,

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,220
and he led the country during difficult times --

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,460
the Great Depression, and World War II.

14
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:47,670
He died while President on April 12, 1945.

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:56,510
Before the presidency, FDR's blood pressure was 140/100.

16
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,680
Today, healthy blood pressure is considered

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,350
to be less than 120/80.

18
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:10,070
So therefore, 140/100 is today considered high blood pressure.

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,651
One year before his death, his blood pressure was 210/120.

20
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:17,860
Today this is called hypertensive crisis,

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,920
and emergency care is needed.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,380
On the other hand, FDR's personal physician

23
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,000
said a moderate degree of atherosclerosis

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,500
although no more than normal for a man of his age.

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,180
Two months before his death, his blood pressure was 260/150,

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,960
and the day of his death was 300/190.

27
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,970
There were early misconceptions in the first half

28
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,730
of the 20th century about blood pressure.

29
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,600
High blood pressure, dubbed essential hypertension,

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,350
was considered important to force blood through arteries,

31
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,240
and it was considered harmful to lower blood pressure.

32
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,980
Today, of course, we know better.

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,100
In the words of Daniel Levy, the Framingham Heart Study

34
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,110
director, "today presidential blood pressure numbers

35
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,310
like FDR's would send the country's leading doctors

36
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,690
racing down hallways, whisking the nation's leader

37
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:28,020
into the cardiac care unit of Bethesda Naval Hospital."

38
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,980
So how did we learn?

39
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,362


40
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:35,330
In the late 1940s, the US government

41
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,220
set out to better understand cardiovascular disease.

42
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,890
The plan was to track a large cohort of initially healthy

43
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,352
patients over their lifetimes.

44
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:50,950
A city was chosen, the city of Framingham, Massachusetts,

45
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,890
to be the site for the study.

46
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,130
Framingham has an appropriate size.

47
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,040
It's not too large, it's not too small.

48
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,890
It has a stable population that doesn't move too much.

49
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,690
And the doctors and residents were quite cooperative.

50
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:16,180
So in 1948, the Framingham Heart Study started.

51
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,660


52
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:28,820
The study included 5,209 patients, aged 30 to 59.

53
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,690
Patients were given a questionnaire

54
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,930
and an examination every two years.

55
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,820
During this examination, their physical characteristics

56
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,260
were recorded, their behavioral characteristics, as well as

57
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,120
test results.

58
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,020
Exams and questions expanded over time,

59
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:52,560
but the key in the study was that the trajectory

60
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,270
of the health of the patients was

61
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,260
followed during their entire lifespan.

62
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,530
In this class, we will build models

63
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,750
using the Framingham data to predict and prevent

64
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,580
heart disease.
