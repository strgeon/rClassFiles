1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,960
The topic of this recitation is election forecasting,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,850
which is the art and science of predicting

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,690
the winner of an election before any votes are actually

4
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:13,910
cast using polling data from likely voters.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,170
In this recitation, we are going to look at the United States

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,740
presidential election.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,170
In the United States, a president

8
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:21,802
is elected every four years.

9
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:24,260
And while there are a number of different political parties

10
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,470
in the US, generally there are only two

11
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,260
competitive candidates.

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,720
There's the Republican candidate,

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:31,780
who tends to be more conservative,

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,550
and the Democratic candidate, who's more liberal.

15
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,290
So for instance a recent Republican president

16
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:40,575
was George W. Bush, and a recent Democratic president

17
00:00:40,575 --> 00:00:43,406
was Barack Obama.

18
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:46,340
Now while in many countries the leader of the country

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,840
is elected using the simple candidate who

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,973
receives the largest number of votes across the entire country

21
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:55,540
is elected, in the United States it's

22
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,850
significantly more complicated.

23
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,860
There are 50 states in the United States,

24
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,730
and each is assigned a number of electoral votes

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,540
based on its population.

26
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,170
So for instance, the most populous state, California,

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,300
in 2012 had nearly 20 times the number of electoral votes

28
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,270
as the least populous states.

29
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,920
And these number of electoral votes

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,850
are reassigned periodically based

31
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,920
on changes of populations between states.

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,180
Within a given state in general, the system

33
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,960
is winner take all in the sense that the candidate who receives

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,430
the most vote in that state gets all of its electoral votes.

35
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,310
And then across the entire country,

36
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,520
the candidate who receives the most electoral votes

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,920
wins the entire presidential election.

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,700
Now while it seems like a somewhat subtle distinction,

39
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,265
the electoral college versus the simple popular vote model,

40
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:46,600
it can have very significant consequences

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,400
on the outcome of the election.

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,500
As an example, let's look at the 2000 presidential election

43
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,670
between George W. Bush and Al Gore.

44
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,340
As we can see on the right here, Al Gore

45
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,520
received more than 500,000 more votes across the entire country

46
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,060
than George W. Bush in terms of the popular vote.

47
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,820
But in terms of the electoral vote,

48
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,009
because of how those votes were distributed,

49
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,060
George Bush actually won the election

50
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,050
because he received five more electoral votes than Al Gore.

51
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,860
So our goal will be to use polling data that's

52
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,850
collected from likely voters before the election

53
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,960
to predict the winner in each state,

54
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,570
and therefore to enable us to predict

55
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,190
the winner of the entire election

56
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,730
in the electoral college system.

57
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,264
While election prediction has long attracted some attention,

58
00:02:33,264 --> 00:02:34,680
there's been a particular interest

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,540
in the problem for the 2012 presidential election,

60
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,550
when then-New York Times columnist Nate

61
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,810
Silver took on the task of predicting

62
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,020
the winner in each state.

63
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,830
To carry out this prediction task,

64
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,330
we're going to use some data from RealClearPolitics.com that

65
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,740
basically represents polling data that was collected

66
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,560
in the months leading up to the 2004, 2008, and 2012 US

67
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,400
presidential elections.

68
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,870
Each row in the data set represents a state

69
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,150
in a particular election year.

70
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,830
And the dependent variable, which is called Republican,

71
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,280
is a binary outcome.

72
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,650
It's 1 if the Republican won that state

73
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,330
in that particular election year,

74
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,830
and a 0 if a Democrat won.

75
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,610
The independent variables, again,

76
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,960
are related to polling data in that state.

77
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,870
So for instance, the Rasmussen and SurveyUSA variables

78
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,970
are related to two major polls that

79
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,040
are assigned across many different states in the United

80
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,140
States.

81
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,720
And it represents the percentage of voters

82
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,950
who said they were likely to vote Republican

83
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,410
minus the percentage who said they

84
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,710
were likely to vote Democrat.

85
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,520
So for instance, if the variable SurveyUSA in our data set

86
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,310
has value -6, it means that 6% more voters

87
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,420
said they were likely to vote Democrat

88
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,889
than said they were likely to vote Republican in that state.

89
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:51,430
We have two additional variables that

90
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,290
capture polling data from a wider range of polls.

91
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,420
Rasmussen and SurveyUSA are definitely not the only polls

92
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,100
that are run on a state by state basis.

93
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,240
DiffCount counts the number of all the polls leading up

94
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,000
to the election that predicted a Republican winner in the state,

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,160
minus the number of polls that predicted a Democratic winner.

96
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,420
And PropR, or proportion Republican,

97
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,850
has the proportion of all those polls leading up

98
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,160
to the election that predicted a Republican winner.

99
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,036
