Hi.

00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,980
I'm John, and I'll be leading the recitation this week.

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,330
We'll be using polling data from the months leading up

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,790
to a presidential election to predict that election's winner.

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,030
We'll go over how to build logistic regression

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,980
models in R, how to select the variables to include

7
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,340
in those models, and how to evaluate the model predictions.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,087
Let's get started.
