1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,740
We next discuss interventions suggested

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,850
by the model developed for the Framingham Heart Study.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,690


4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,020
The first intervention has to do with drugs

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,920
to lower blood pressure.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,670
In FDR's time, hypertension drugs

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,410
were too toxic for practical use.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,632
But in the 1950s, the diuretic chlorothiazide was developed,

9
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:28,520
and the Framingham Heart Study gave Ed Freis

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,090
the evidence needed to argue for testing effects for blood

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,630
pressure drugs.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,810
In fact, the Veterans Administration Trial

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,810
was conducted.

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,470
This was a randomized, double blind clinical trial,

15
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,490
that found decreased risk of coronary heart disease.

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,770
Now, the market for diuretics worldwide

17
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,940
is more than a billion dollars.

18
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,260
Another intervention had to do with-- to lower cholesterol.

19
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,690
Despite the Framingham results, early cholesterol drugs

20
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,750
were too toxic for practical use.

21
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,270
But in the 1970s, the first statins were developed.

22
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,890
The study of 4,444 patients with CHD

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,900
revealed that statins cause a 37% risk

24
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,510
reduction of a second heart attack.

25
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:27,470
Furthermore, a study of 6,595 men with high cholesterol

26
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:33,420
revealed that statins cause a 32% risk reduction in deaths.

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,150
Now, the market for statins worldwide

28
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,440
is more than $20 billion.

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,659
