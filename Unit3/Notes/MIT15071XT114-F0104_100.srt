00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,640
So far, we have used what is known as internal validation

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,600
to test our model.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,300
This means that we took the data from one set of patients

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,990
and split them into a training set and a testing set.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,530
While this confirms that our model is

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,220
good at making predictions for patients in the Framingham

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,120
Heart Study population, it's unclear

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,820
if the model generalizes to other populations.

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,770
The Framingham cohort of patients

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:30,600
were white, middle class adults.

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,350
To be sure that the model extends

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,670
to other types of patients, we need

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,100
to test on other populations.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,265
This is known as external validation.

15
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:41,990


16
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,820
There have been many studies to test the Framingham model

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,990
from the influential 1998 paper on diverse cohorts.

18
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,510
This table shows a sample of studies

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,590
that tested the model on populations

20
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,730
with different races.

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,570
The researchers for each study collected the same risk

22
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,390
factors used in the original study,

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,360
predicted CHD using the Framingham Heart Study model,

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,440
and then analyzed how accurate the model

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,940
was for that population.

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,700
For some populations, the Framingham model was accurate.

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,180
For the ARIC study that tested the model with black men,

28
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,050
this figure shows a bar graph of how the Framingham predictions

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,600
compare with the actual results.

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,760
The gray bars are the predictions.

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,830
And the black bars are the actual outcomes.

32
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:35,840
The patients are sorted on the x-axis by predicted risk

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,550
and on the y-axis by the percentage of patients

34
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,060
in each group who actually developed CHD.

35
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,020
For the most part, the predictions are accurate.

36
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,660
There's one group for which the model under-predicted the risk

37
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,270
and one group for which the model over-predicted the risk.

38
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,240
But for other populations, the Framingham model

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,850
was not as accurate.

40
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,540
For the HHS study with Japanese-American men,

41
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,440
the Framingham model systematically

42
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,090
over-predicts a risk of CHD.

43
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,729


44
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,650
The model can be recalibrated for this population

45
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,060
by scaling down the predictions.

46
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,510
This changes the predicted risk but not

47
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,380
the order of the predictions.

48
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,580
The high risk patients still have higher predictions

49
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,150
than the lower risk patients.

50
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,290
This allows the model to have more accurate risk estimates

51
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,130
for populations not included in the original group of patients.

52
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,880
For models that will be used on different populations

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,390
than the one used to create the model,

54
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,570
external validation is critical.
