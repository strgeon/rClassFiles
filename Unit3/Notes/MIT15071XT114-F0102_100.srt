1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,710
In this lecture, we'll be using analytical models

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,900
to prevent heart disease.

3
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,050
The first step is to identify risk factors,

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,350
or the independent variables, that we will use in our model.

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,490
Then, using data, we'll create a logistic regression model

6
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,800
to predict heart disease.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,570
Using more data, we'll validate our model

8
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:25,520
to make sure it performs well out of sample

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,340
and on different populations than the training set

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,310
population.

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:33,260
Lastly, we'll discuss how medical interventions

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,350
can be defined using the model.

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,930


14
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,040
We'll be predicting the 10-year risk

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,670
of coronary heart disease or CHD.

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,600
This was the subject of an important 1998 paper

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,420
introducing what is known as the Framingham Risk Score.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,210
This is one of the most influential applications

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,890
of the Framingham Heart Study data.

20
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,630
We'll use logistic regression to create a similar model.

21
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:06,170
CHD is a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart.

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,320
This is one type of heart disease, which

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,510
has been the leading cause of death worldwide since 1921.

24
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,230
In 2008, 7.3 million people died from CHD.

25
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,500
Even though the number of deaths due to CHD is still very high,

26
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,480
age-adjusted death rates have actually

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,860
declined 60% since 1950.

28
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,140
This is in part due to earlier detection and monitoring partly

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,210
because of the Framingham Heart Study.

30
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,050


31
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,920
Before building a logistic regression model,

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,570
we need to identify the independent variables

33
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,510
we want to use.

34
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,530
When predicting the risk of a disease,

35
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:53,070
we want to identify what are known as risk factors.

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,020
These are the variables that increase

37
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,340
the chances of developing a disease.

38
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,480
The term risk factors was actually

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,140
coined by William Kannell and Roy Dawber

40
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,020
from the Framingham Heart Study.

41
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,050
Identifying these risk factors is

42
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,455
the key to successful prediction of CHD.

43
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:13,220


44
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,140
In this lecture, we'll focus on the risk factors

45
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,060
that they collected data for in the original data

46
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,100
collection for the Framingham Heart Study.

47
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,320
We'll be using an anonymized version

48
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,690
of the original data that was collected.

49
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,490
This data set includes several demographic risk factors--

50
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,690
the sex of the patient, male or female;

51
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:39,200
the age of the patient in years; the education level coded

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,590
as either 1 for some high school,

53
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,900
2 for a high school diploma or GED,

54
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,920
3 for some college or vocational school,

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,700
and 4 for a college degree.

56
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,680
The data set also includes behavioral risk factors

57
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,060
associated with smoking-- whether or not

58
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,120
the patient is a current smoker and the number of cigarettes

59
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,510
that the person smoked on average in one day.

60
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,930
While it is now widely known that smoking increases

61
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,985
the risk of heart disease, the idea

62
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:16,580
of smoking being bad for you was a novel idea in the 1940s.

63
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,232
Medical history risk factors were also included.

64
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:21,940
These were whether or not the patient was

65
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,660
on blood pressure medication, whether or not the patient had

66
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,260
previously had a stroke, whether or not the patient was

67
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,720
hypertensive, and whether or not the patient had diabetes.

68
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,650


69
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,220
Lastly, the data set includes risk factors

70
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,740
from the first physical examination of the patient.

71
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,720
The total cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure,

72
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,370
diastolic blood pressure, Body Mass Index, or BMI, heart rate,

73
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,260
and blood glucose level of the patient were measured.

74
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,480
In the next video, we'll use these risk factors

75
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,450
to see if we can predict the 10-year risk CHD.

76
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,088
