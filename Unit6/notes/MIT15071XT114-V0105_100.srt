1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,170
In this video, we'll discuss the method

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,770
of hierarchical clustering.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,490
In hierarchical clustering, the clusters

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,050
are formed by each data point starting in its own cluster.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,100
As a small example, suppose we have five data points.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,220
Each data point is labeled as belonging in its own cluster.

7
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,340
So this data point is in the red cluster, this one's

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:28,070
in the blue cluster, this one's in the purple cluster,

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,640
this one's in the green cluster, and this one's

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,840
in the yellow cluster.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,520
Then hierarchical clustering combines the two nearest

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,870
clusters into one cluster.

13
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,620
We'll use Euclidean and Centroid distances

14
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,840
to decide which two clusters are the closest.

15
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,570
In our example, the green and yellow clusters

16
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,590
are closest together.

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,690
So we would combine these two clusters into one cluster.

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,170
So now the green cluster has two points,

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,710
and the yellow cluster is gone.

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,660
Now this process repeats.

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,310
We again find the two nearest clusters,

22
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:07,160
which this time are the green cluster and the purple cluster,

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,870
and we combine them into one cluster.

24
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,050
Now the green cluster has three points,

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,820
and the purple cluster is gone.

26
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,130
Now the two nearest clusters are the red and blue clusters.

27
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,360
So we would combine these two clusters

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,400
into one cluster, the red cluster.

29
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,380
So now we have just two clusters, the red one

30
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,160
and the green one.

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,720
So now the final step is to combine these two clusters

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,870
into one cluster.

33
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,580
So at the end of hierarchical clustering,

34
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,780
all of our data points are in a single cluster.

35
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,060
The hierarchical cluster process can

36
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,260
be displayed through what's called a dendrogram.

37
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,180
The data points are listed along the bottom,

38
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,470
and the lines show how the clusters were combined.

39
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,880
The height of the lines represents how far

40
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,280
apart the clusters were when they were combined.

41
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,180
So points 1 and 4 were pretty close

42
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,260
together when they were combined.

43
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,270
But when we combined the two clusters at the end,

44
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:10,620
they were significantly farther apart.

45
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,040
We can use a dendrogram to decide how many clusters we

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,480
want for our final clustering model.

47
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,120
This dendrogram shows the clustering process

48
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,230
with ten data points.

49
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,720
The easiest way to pick the number of clusters you want

50
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,930
is to draw a horizontal line across the dendrogram.

51
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,595
The number of vertical lines that line crosses

52
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:35,700
is the number of clusters there will be.

53
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,780
In this case, our line crosses two vertical lines,

54
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,400
meaning that we will have two clusters-- one cluster

55
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
with points 5, 2, and 7, and one cluster with the remaining

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,600
points.

57
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,510
The farthest this horizontal line

58
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,160
can move up and down in the dendrogram

59
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,700
without hitting one of the horizontal lines

60
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,420
of the dendrogram, the better that choice

61
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,070
of the number of clusters is.

62
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,200
If we instead selected three clusters,

63
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,950
this line can't move as far up and down

64
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,770
without hitting horizontal lines in the dendrogram.

65
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,060
This probably means that the two cluster choice is better.

66
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,970
But when picking the number of clusters,

67
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,700
you should also consider how many clusters

68
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,190
make sense for the particular application

69
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,000
you're working with.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,770
After selecting the number of clusters you want,

71
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:34,340
you should analyze your clusters to see if they're meaningful.

72
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,240
This can be done by looking at basic statistics

73
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,600
in each cluster, like the mean, maximum, and minimum values

74
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,730
in each cluster and each variable.

75
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,390
You can also check to see if the clusters have

76
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,150
a feature in common that was not used in the clustering,

77
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,210
like an outcome variable.

78
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,520
This often indicates that your clusters

79
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,580
might help improve a predictive model.

80
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,610
In the next video, we'll cluster our movies by genre,

81
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,730
and then analyze our clusters to see

82
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,550
how they can be used to perform content filtering.
