Hello.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,690
This week we'll discuss how analytics

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,100
can be used to make recommendations

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,020
for movies and for health.

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,190
In the first lecture, we discuss how

6
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:13,130
Netflix offered the million dollar prize

7
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,700
to improve their movie recommendation system.

8
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,620
In the second lecture, we discuss how health care claims

9
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,210
data can be used to predict the occurrence of a heart attack

10
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,040
and to better understand patterns.

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,360
Through these examples, we'll discuss the method

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,550
of clustering, which is used to find similarities

13
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,020
and patterns in data.

14
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's get started.
