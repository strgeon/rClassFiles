1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,110
What is the impact of clustering?

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:05,100
Clustering members within each cost bucket

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,087
yielded better predictions for heart attacks within clusters.

4
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:10,670
Grouping patients in clusters exhibits

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,610
temporal diagnostic patterns within nine months

6
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,840
of a heart attack.

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,450
These patterns can be incorporated

8
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,920
in the diagnostic rules for heart attacks.

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,690
The approach shows that using analytics for early heart

10
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,500
failure detection through pattern recognition

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,245
can lead to interesting new insights.

12
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:29,820


13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,230
The findings here are reinforced by results from our research.

IBM, Sutter Health, and Geisinger Health Systems

15
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,490
partnered in 2009 to research analytics tools

16
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,790
in view of early detection.

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,110
Steve Steinhubl, a cardiologist from Geisinger,

18
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,670
wrote, "our early research showed

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,240
the signs and symptoms of heart failure in patients

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,670
are often documented years before diagnosis.

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,290
The pattern of documentation can offer clinically useful signals

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,550
for early detection of this deadly disease."
