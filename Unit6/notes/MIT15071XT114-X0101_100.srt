1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,670
In this recitation, we will see how

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:06,150
to apply clustering techniques to segment images,

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,190
with the main application being geared towards medical image

4
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,770
segmentation.

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,900
At the end of this recitation, you

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,379
will get a head start on how to cluster an MRI brain

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,442
image by tissue substances and locate pathological anatomies.

8
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:23,500
Image segmentation is the process

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,200
of partitioning digital images into regions, or segments,

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,750
that share the same visual characteristics, such as color,

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,890
intensity, or texture.

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,250
The segments should also be meaningful,

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,040
as in they should correspond to particular surfaces, objects,

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,430
or even parts of an object.

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,490
Think of having an image of a water pond,

16
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,290
a mountain chain in the backdrop, and the sky.

17
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,430
Segmenting this image should ideally

18
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,690
detect the three different objects

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,600
and assign their corresponding pixels

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,000
to three different regions.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,830
In few words, the goal of image segmentation

22
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,810
is to modify the representation of an image from pixel data

23
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,980
into something meaningful to us and easier to analyze.

24
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,110
Image segmentation has a wide applicability.

25
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,595
A major practical application is in the field

26
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:14,670
of medical imaging, where image segments often

27
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,140
correspond to different tissues, organs, pathologies, or tumors.

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,530
Image segmentation helps locate these geometrically complex

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,530
objects and measure their volume.

30
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,950
Another application is detecting instances

31
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,110
of semantic objects such as humans, buildings, and others.

32
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,850
The two major domains that have seen much attention

33
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,560
recently include face and pedestrian detection.

34
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,870
The main uses of facial detection, for instance,

35
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,640
include the development of the auto-focus in digital cameras

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,150
and face recognition commonly used in video surveillance.

37
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,290
Other important applications are fingerprint and iris

38
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,470
recognition.

39
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,800
For instance, fingerprint recognition

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,450
tries to identify print patterns, including

41
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,520
aggregate characteristics of ridges and minutiae points.

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,270
In this recitation, we will look in particular

43
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,960
at the medical imaging application.

44
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,860
Various methods have been proposed to segment images.

45
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,160
Clustering methods are used to group the points

46
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,520
into clusters according to their characteristic features,

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,910
for instance, intensity values.

48
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,930
These clusters are then mapped back

49
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,740
to the original spatial domain to produce

50
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,380
a segmentation of the image.

51
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,960
Another technique is edge detection,

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,020
which is based on detecting discontinuities or boundaries.

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,230
For instance, in a gray-scale image,

54
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,600
a boundary would correspond to an abrupt change

55
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,180
in the gray level.

56
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,570
Instead of finding boundaries of regions in the image,

57
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,560
there are other techniques called region

58
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,760
growing methods, which start dividing

59
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,180
the image into small regions.

60
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,540
Then, they sequentially merge these regions together

61
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,340
if they are sufficiently similar.

62
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,350
In this recitation, our focus is on clustering methods.

63
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,560
In particular, we will review hierarchical and k-means

64
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,160
clustering techniques and how to use them in R.

65
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,530
We will restrict ourselves to gray-scale images.

66
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,890
Our first example is a low-resolution flower image

67
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,920
whose pixel intensity information

68
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,360
is given the data set flower.csv.

69
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,240
Our second and major example involves two weighted MRI

70
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,810
images of the brain.

71
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,590
One image corresponds to a healthy patient,

72
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,610
and the other one corresponds to a patient with a tumor

73
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,950
called oligodendroglioma.

74
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,990
The pixel intensity information of these two images

75
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:40,410
are given in the data sets healthy and tumor.csv.

76
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,370
The last video will compare the use, pros,

77
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,430
and cons of all the analytics tools that we have seen so far.

78
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,160
I hope that this will help you synthesize all

79
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,460
that you've learned to give you an edge in the class

80
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,590
competition that is coming up soon.
