00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499


1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,247
Claims data offers an expansive view of the patient's health

2
00:00:03,247 --> 00:00:04,230
history.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,855
Specifically, claims data include information

4
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:10,710
on demographics, medical history, and medications.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,240
They offer insights regarding a patient's risk.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,710
And as I will demonstrate, may reveal indicative signals

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,050
and patterns.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,980
We'll use health insurance claims

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,695
filed for about 7,000 members from January 2000

10
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:30,620
until November 2007.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,980
We concentrated on members with the following attributes.

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,200
At least five claims with coronary artery disease

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,720
diagnosis, at least five claims with hypertension

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,480
diagnostic codes, at least 100 total medical claims,

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,420
at least five pharmacy claims, and data

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,740
from at least five years.

17
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,020
These selections yield patients with a high risk

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,030
of heart attack,

19
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,746
and a reasonably rich medical history with continuous

20
00:00:56,746 --> 00:00:57,245
coverage.

21
00:00:57,245 --> 00:01:00,820


22
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,360
Let us discuss how we aggregated this data.

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,930
The resulting data sets includes about 20 million health

24
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,520
insurance entries, including individual, medical,

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,150
and pharmaceutical records.

26
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,600
Diagnosis, procedures, and drug codes in the data

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,640
set comprised tens of thousands of attributes.

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,460
The codes were aggregated into groups.

29
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,500
218 diagnosis groups, 180 procedure groups,

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,150
538 drug groups.

31
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,350
46 diagnosis groups were considered

32
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,720
by clinicians as possible risk factors for heart attacks.

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,240


34
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,760
Let us discuss how we view the data over time.

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,940
It is important in this study to view the medical records

36
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,100
chronologically, and to represent a patient's diagnosis

37
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,770
profile over time.

38
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,970
So we record the cost and number of medical claims and hospital

39
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,390
visits by a diagnosis.

40
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,440
All the observations we have span over five years of data.

41
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,890
They were split into 21 periods, each 90 days in length.

42
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,110
We examine nine months of diagnostic history,

43
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,440
leading up to heart attack or no heart attack event,

44
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,980
and align the data to make observations that are date-independent,

45
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,910
while preserving the order of events.

46
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,950
We recorded the diagnostic history in three periods.

47
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,230
Zero to three months before the event,

48
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,090
three to six months before the event,

49
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,600
and six to nine months before the event.

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,280


51
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,940
What was the target variable we were trying to predict?

52
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,940
The target prediction variable is the occurrence

53
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,350
of a heart attack.

54
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,730
We define this from a combination of several claims.

55
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,060
Namely, diagnosis of a heart attack,

56
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,700
alongside a trip to the emergency room,

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,000
followed by subsequent hospitalization.

58
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,510
Only considering heart attack diagnosis

59
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,340
that are associated with a visit to the emergency room,

60
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,810
and following hospitalization helps

61
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,055
ensure that the target outcome is in fact a heart attack

62
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:06,100
event.

63
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,190
The target variable is binary.

64
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,670
It is denoted by plus 1 or minus 1

65
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,790
for the occurrence or non-occurrence of a heart

66
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:15,790
attack in the targeted period of 90 days.

67
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,720


68
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,090
How is the data organized?

69
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,690
There were 147 variables.

70
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,650
Variable one is the patient's identification number,

71
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,030
and variable two is the patient's gender.

72
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,160
There were variables related to the diagnoses group

73
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,410
counts nine, six, and three months before the heart attack

74
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,660
target period.

75
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,952
There were variables related to the total cost nine, six,

76
00:03:40,952 --> 00:03:42,910
and three months before the heart attack target

77
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,630
period, and the final variable 147,

78
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,870
includes the classification of whether the event was a heart

79
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,020
attack or not.

80
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,860


81
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,940
Cost of medical care is a good summary of a person's health.

82
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,110
In our database, the total cost of medical care in the three 90

83
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:11,160
day periods preceding the heart attack target event ranged from

84
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,769
$0 to $636,000 and approximately 70%

85
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,880
of the overall cost was generated by only 11%

86
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,360
of the population.

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,920
This means that the highest patients

88
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,460
with high medical expenses are a very small proportion

89
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,810
of the data, and could skew our final results.

90
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,700
According to the American Medical Association, only 10%

91
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,640
of individuals have projected medical expenses

92
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,790
of approximately $10,000 or greater

93
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,960
per year, which is more than four times greater

94
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,476
than the average projected medical expenses of $2,400

95
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:49,880
per year.

96
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,090
To lessen the effects of these high-cost outliers,

97
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,960
we divided the data into different cost buckets,

98
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,770
based on the findings of the American Medical Association.

99
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,140
We did not want to have too many cost bins

100
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,840
because the size of the data set.

101
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,140
The table in the slide gives a summary

102
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,990
of the cost bucket partitions.

103
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,550
Patients with expenses over $10,000 in the nine month

104
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,980
period were allocated to cost bucket 3.

105
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,840
Patients with less than $2,000 in expenses

106
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,910
were allocated to cost bucket 1.

107
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,170
And the remaining patients with costs between $2,000 and $10,000

108
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,850
to cost bucket 2.

109
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:36,360
Please note that the majority of patients, 4,400 out of 6,500,

110
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,590
or 67.5% of all patients fell into the first bucket

111
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,470
of low expenses.
