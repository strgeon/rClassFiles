Hi.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,400
My name is Nataly, and I will be leading this recitation.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,000
We will review hierarchical and k-means clustering techniques

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,700
and apply them to segment gray scale images--

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,430
in particular, MRI brain images.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,470
Then we will conclude by overviewing all the analytics

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,610
tools we have seen so far in this class

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,760
to prepare for the class competition.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,700
Let's get started.
