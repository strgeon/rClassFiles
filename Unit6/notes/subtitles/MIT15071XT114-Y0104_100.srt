00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,950
Let us see what we learned about the patterns that emerge.

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,180
We will show that the clusters are interpretable

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,990
and reveal unique patterns of diagnostic history

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,670
among the population.

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:18,350
We selected six patterns to present in this lecture--

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,860
Cluster 1, 6, and 7, in Cost Bucket 2,

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,930
and Clusters 4, 5, and 10, in Cost Bucket 3.

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,330


9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,310
The first pattern shows the occurrence of chest pain

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,890
three months before the heart attack.

11
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,420
Note that the red dots depict the visits per diagnosis

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,720
for patients in Cluster 1-- this is, we think,

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,350
Bucket 2-- and the blue dots depict the visits

14
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,260
per diagnosis for patients in Bucket 2 throughout.

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,430
Note the very significant increase

16
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,850
for visits related to chest pains

17
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,290
three months before the event.

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:00,910
About 17, three months before for the red patients,

19
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,469
and about 1 and 1/2 visits for the blue patients.

20
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,710


21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,650
The next pattern reveals an increasing occurrence

22
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:17,570
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, for short.

23
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,240
Patients from Cluster 7 in Bucket 2

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,640
have regular doctor visits for COPD.

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,030
Note that nine months before, we have

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,160
4 and 1/2 visits versus 0.5 visits.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,110
Six months before, we have almost 7 visits versus 1/2

28
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,680
a visit, and three months before, we

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,510
have 9 visits versus 1/2 a visit for COPD,

30
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,190
so a clear increasing pattern.

31
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,910
The next pattern shows gradually increasing occurrence

32
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,350
of anemia.

33
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,500
The red line shows the patients in Cluster 4

34
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,530
increasingly visit the doctor for anemia from nine months

35
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,390
on before the event.

36
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,600
Nine months before, members have an average of 9 visits

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,740
to the doctor for anemia.

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,430


39
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:19,620
This increases to an average of 11 visits six months

40
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,970
before the event, and then an average of 15

41
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,606
visits three months before the event, a clear increasing

42
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:26,106
pattern.

43
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:32,430


44
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,375
The final pattern shows the occurrence of diabetes

45
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:37,210
as a pattern for heart attacks.

46
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,320
It is well known that both types 1 and 2

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,170
diabetes are associated with accelerated atherosclerosis,

48
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,250
one of the main causes of myocardial infarction-- heart

49
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,800
attacks, that is.

50
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,180
Well known diagnoses associated with heart attacks,

51
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,430
such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia,

52
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,700
characterize many of the patterns of the consistency

53
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,735
of care throughout all of the cost buckets and clustering

54
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:05,235
models.

55
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:09,630


56
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,970
You observe a difference, here, of the number

57
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,480
of visits for diabetes for the population

58
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,090
that had the event versus the average population.
