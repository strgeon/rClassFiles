00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580


1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,280
Recommendation systems are used in many different areas

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,150
other than movies.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,960
Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, said

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,110
that, "If I have 3 million customers on the web,

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,430
I should have 3 million stores on the web."

6
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,700
The internet allows for mass personalization,

7
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,440
and recommendation systems are a key part of that.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,560
Recommendation systems build models

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,990
about users' preferences to personalize the user

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,620
experience.

11
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,340
This helps users find items they might not have searched for,

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,990
like a new favorite band, an old friend who

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,740
uses the same social media network, or a book or song

14
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,730
that they're likely to enjoy.

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,260
Recommendation systems are a cornerstone

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,450
of these top businesses.

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,170
Social networking sites, like Facebook,

18
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,150
music streaming sites, like Pandora, and retail companies,

19
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,610
like Amazon, all provide recommendation systems

20
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,860
for their users.

21
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,840
Both collaborative filtering and content filtering

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,740
are used in practice.

23
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,230
Collaborative filtering is used by companies

24
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,850
like Amazon, Facebook, and Google News.

25
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,080
Content filtering is used by companies

26
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,380
like Pandora, Rotten Tomatoes, and See This Next.

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,420
And Netflix uses both collaborative filtering

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,890
and content filtering.

29
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,120
So now let's go back to the Netflix prize.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,790
29 days after last call was announced, on July 25, 2009,

31
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:40,020
the team The Ensemble submitted a 10.09% improvement, beating

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,700
the 10.05% improvement that was submitted by Bellkor's

33
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,190
Pragmatic Chaos to signal last call.

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,680
But by the time Netflix stopped accepting submissions the next

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,830
day, Bellkor's Pragmatic Chaos had also submitted a 10.09%

36
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,930
improvement, and The Ensemble had submitted a 10.10%

37
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,620
improvement.

38
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,340
To really test the algorithms, Netflix

39
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,470
tested them on a private test set

40
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,800
that the teams had never seen before.

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,840
This is the true test of predictive ability.

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,480
On September 18, 2009, Netflix announced that the winning team

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,200
was Bellkor's Pragmatic Chaos.

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,490
They won the competition and the $1 million grand prize.

45
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,470
Recommendation systems provide a significant edge

46
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,310
to many companies.

47
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,860
In today's digital age, businesses often have hundreds

48
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,980
of thousands of items to offer their customers,

49
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,645
whether they're movies, songs , or people they might know

50
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:42,340
on Facebook.

51
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:45,160
Excellent recommendation systems can make or break

52
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,140
these businesses.

53
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,430
Clustering algorithms, which are tailored

54
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,970
to find similar customers or similar items,

55
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,030
form the backbone of many of these recommendation systems.

56
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,050
Clustering also has many other interesting applications.

57
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,720
In the next lecture, we'll see how clustering

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,060
can be used to improve the predictive ability

59
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,650
of classification methods.
