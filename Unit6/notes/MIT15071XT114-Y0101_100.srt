1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,070
In this lecture, we discuss the idea

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,930
of predictive analytics in medicine.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,690
Specifically, we introduce the idea

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:08,770
of using clustering methods for better predicting heart

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,090
attacks.

6
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,510
Heart attacks are a common complication of coronary heart

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,120
disease, resulting from the interruption of blood supply

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,162
to part of the heart.

9
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:21,620
Heart attack is the number one cause

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,830
of death for both men and women in the United States.

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,080
About one in every four deaths is due to heart attack.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,110
A 2012 report from the American Heart Association

13
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,340
estimates about 715,000 Americans have a heart attack

14
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,720
every year.

15
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,680
To put this number into perspective,

16
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,220
this means that every 20 seconds, a person

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,160
has a heart attack in the United States.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,880
It is also equivalent of September the 11th

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,190
repeating itself every 24 hours, 365 days a year.

20
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,840
Nearly half of these attacks occur

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,300
without prior warning signs.

22
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,620
In fact, 250,000 Americans die of sudden cardiac death

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,710
yearly, which means 680 people every day die

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,200
of sudden cardiac death.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,360


26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,550
A heart attack has well-known symptoms-- chest pain,

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:17,770
shortness of breath, upper body pain, nausea.

28
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,340
The nature of heart attacks, however,

29
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,450
makes it hard to predict, prevent, and even diagnose.

30
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,380
Here are some statistics.

31
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,000
25% of heart attacks are silent.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,900
47% of sudden cardiac deaths occur outside hospitals,

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,270
suggesting that many patients do not act on early warning signs.

34
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,250
Only 27% percent of respondents to a 2005 survey

35
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:48,190
recognized the symptoms and called 911 for help.

36
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,190
How can analytics help?

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,390
The key to helping patients is to understand

38
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,430
the clinical characteristics of patients

39
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,700
in whom heart attacks was missed.

40
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,500
We need to better understand the patterns in a patient's

41
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,867
diagnostic history that link to heart attack

42
00:02:03,867 --> 00:02:05,450
and to predicting whether a patient is

43
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,300
at risk for a heart attack.

44
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,770
We'll see, in this lecture, how analytics

45
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,390
helps to understand patterns of heart attacks

46
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,160
and to provide good predictions that in turn lead to improved

47
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,280
monitoring and taking action early and effectively.
